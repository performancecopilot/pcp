.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogsummary
prints statistical information about metrics of numeric type contained within
the files of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log.  The default output prints
time averages for both counter and non-counter metrics.
The archive log has the base name
.IR archive ,
typically created using
.BR pmlogger (1).
.PP
The metrics of interest are named in the
.I metricname
arguments.
If
.I metricname
is a non-leaf node in the Performance Metrics Name Space (\c
.BR pmns (5)),
then
.B pmlogsummary
will recursively descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes.
If no
.I metricname
argument is given, the root of the namespace is used.
.PP
Normally
.B pmlogsummary
operates on the default
.BR pmns (5),
however if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative namespace is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.PP
The command line options
.B \-S
and
.B \-T
can be used to specify a time window over which metrics should be summarized.
These options are common to most Performance Co-Pilot tools and are fully
described in
.BR PCPIntro (1).
.PP
The remaining options control the specific information to be reported.
Metrics with counter semantics are converted to rates before being
evaluated.
.TP
.B \-a
Print all information.  This is equivalent to
.BR \-blmMy .
.TP
.B \-b
Print both forms of averaging, that is both stochastic and time averaging.
.TP
.B \-B
Print the approximate distribution of values, using histogram bins such
that the value range (minimum - maximum) for each metric is divided
equally into
.I nbins
bins, and each bin accumulates the frequency of observed values in the
corresponding range.
Refer to the ``OUTPUT FORMAT'' section below for a description of how the
distribution of values is reported).
.TP
.B \-f
Spreadsheet format \- the tab character is used to delimit each field
printed.  This option is intended to allow
.B pmlogsummary
output to be imported directly into common spreadsheet applications.
.TP
.B \-F
Spreadsheet format \- the comma character is used to delimit each field
printed.  This option is intended to allow
.B pmlogsummary
output to be imported directly into common spreadsheet applications which
support the Comma Separated Value (.csv) format.
.TP
.B \-H
Print a one-line header at the start showing what each field represents.
.TP
.B \-l
Also print the archive label, showing the log format version,
the time and date for the start and end of the archive time window,
and the host from which the performance metrics values were collected.
.TP
.B \-i
Also print the time at which the minimum value was logged.  The format of this
timestamp is described in the ``OUTPUT FORMAT'' section below.
.TP
.B \-I
Also print the time at which the maximum value was logged.  The format of this
timestamp is described in the ``OUTPUT FORMAT'' section below.
.TP
.B \-m
Also print the minimum logged value for each metric.
.TP
.B \-M
Also print the maximum logged value for each metric.
.TP
.B \-s
Print (only) the sum of all logged values for each metric.
.TP
.B \-N
Suppress any warnings resulting from individual archive fetches (default).
.TP
.B \-p
Print all floating point numbers with 
.I precision
digits after the decimal place.
.TP
.B \-v
Report (verbosely) on warnings resulting from individual archive fetches.
.TP
.B \-x
Print stochastic averages instead of the default (time averages).
.TP
.B \-y
Also print the number of samples encountered in the archive for each metric.
.PP
By default,
.B pmlogsummary
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on the
system where
.B pmlogsummary
is run.
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
The
.B \-z
option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as specified in
the label record of the archive log.
.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
The
.B pmlogsummary
output format is spartan as it is intended to be post-processed with
standard tools.  This means that there is no annotation associated with each
output field which would make processing harder.  The intention is that
.B pmlogsummary
output be massaged into a format which can be used by a spreadsheet program,
is suitable for inclusion in a web page, or whatever.
.PP
For each metric,
.B pmlogsummary
produces a single output line as follows:
.PP
.in 1.0i
.ft CW
.nf
\f2metricname\f1  \f2value(s)\f1 \f2units\f1
.fi
.ft R
.in
.PP
For metrics with multiple instances, 
.B pmlogsummary
produces multiple lines of output as follows:
.PP
.in 1.0i
.ft CW
.nf
\f2metricname\f1 ["\f2instance 1\f1"] \f2value(s)\f1 \f2units\f1
\f2metricname\f1 ["\f2instance 2\f1"] \f2value(s)\f1 \f2units\f1
\f2metricname\f1 ["\f2instance N\f1"] \f2value(s)\f1 \f2units\f1
.fi
.ft R
.in
.PP
The printed \f2value(s)\f1 for each metric always follow this order:
stochastic average, time average, minimum, minimum timestamp, maximum,
maximum timestamp, count, [bin 1 range], bin 1 count, ... [bin
.I nbins
range], bin
.I nbins
count.
The individual values for each metric are space-separated (unless the
.B \-f
option is used).
.PP
All counter metrics which are measured in units of time will be converted
to seconds before being rate converted and used in the
.B pmlogsummary
calculations.  The values calculated for these metrics are also printed
in seconds.
.PP
The units will be displayed in the format described by
.BR pmUnitsStr (3).
.PP
Given either of the
.B -i
or
.B -I
options,
.B pmlogsummary
produces two different timestamp formats, depending on the
interval over which it is run.
For an interval greater than 24 hours, the date is displayed in addition
to the time at which the maxima and/or minima occurred.
If the extent of the data being checked is less than 24 hours,
a more precise format is used (time is displayed with millisecond
precision, but without the date).
.PP
.SH NOTES
The average for an individual metric is calculated as follows:
.PP
Non-counter metrics are averaged using stochastic averaging -
each observation has an equal weighting towards
the calculation of the average (the sum of all values divided
by the total number of values, for each metric).
.PP
Counter metrics are averaged using time averaging (by default),
but the
.B \-x
option can be used to specify that counters be averaged using 
the stochastic method instead.  When calculating a time average,
the sum of the product of each sample value multiplied by the time difference
between each sample, is divided by the total time over which
that metric was logged.
.PP
Counter metrics whose measurements do not span 90% of the archive will be
printed with the metric name prefixed by an asterisk (*).
