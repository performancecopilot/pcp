.TH NEWHELP 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3newhelp\f1 \- generate a performance metrics help database
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_BINADM_DIR/newhelp\f1
[\f3\-vV?\f1]
[\f3\-n\f1 \f2pmnsfile\f1]
[\f3\-o\f1 \f2outputfile\f1]
[\f2file\f1 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B newhelp
generates the
Performance Co-Pilot
help text files used by
Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs).
.PP
Normally
.B newhelp
operates on the default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however
if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative namespace is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.PP
When there is only one input file,
the base name of the new database is derived from the name of the input
.IR file ,
otherwise the
.B \-o
flag must be given to explicitly name the database.
If no input files are supplied,
.B newhelp
reads from the standard input stream,
in which case the
.B \-o
flag must be given.
.PP
If the output file name is determined to be
.BR foo ,
.B newhelp
will create
.B foo.dir
and
.BR foo.pag .
.PP
The
.B \-V
flag causes verbose messages to be printed while
.B newhelp
is parsing its input.
.PP
The first line of each entry in a help source file consists of an
\&``@''
character beginning the line
followed by a space and then
the performance metric name and a one line description of the metric.
Following lines (up to the next line beginning with ``@''
or end of file) may contain a verbose help description.
E.g.
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
#
# This is an example of newhelp's input syntax
#
@ kernel.all.cpu.idle CPU idle time
A cumulative count of the number of milliseconds
of CPU idle time, summed over all processors.
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
Three-part numeric metric identifiers (PMIDs) may be used in place of metric names,
e.g. \c
.ft CR
60.0.23
.ft 1
rather than
.ft CR
kernel.all.cpu.idle
.ft 1
in the example above.
Other than for dynamic metrics
(where the existence of a metric is known to
a PMDA, but not visible in the PMNS and hence has no name that
could be known to
.IR newhelp )
use of this syntactic variant is not encouraged.
.PP
Lines beginning with ``#''
are ignored, as are blank lines in the file before the first ``@''.
The verbose help text is optional.
.PP
As a special case,
a ``metric'' name of the form
.I NNN.MM
(for numeric
.I NNN
and
.IR MM )
is interpreted as an
instance domain identification,
and the text describes the instance domain.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIoutout\fR
Specify base name for
.I output
files.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fIpmnsfile\fR, \fB\-\-namespace\fR=\fIpmnsfile\fR
Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space
.RB ( PMNS (5))
from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fIversion\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR=\fIversion\fR
Set output version.
This options is deprecated, the only supported value is
.BR 2 .
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP 5
.I $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*
default PMNS specification files
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
