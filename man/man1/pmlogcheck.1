.TH PMLOGCHECK 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmlogcheck\f1 \- checks for invalid data in a PCP archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmlogcheck\f1
[\f3\-lz\f1]
[\f3\-n\f1 \f2pmnsfile\f1]
[\f3\-S\f1 \f2start\f1]
[\f3\-T\f1 \f2finish\f1]
[\f3\-Z\f1 \f2timezone\f1]
\f2archive\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogcheck
prints information about the nature of any invalid data which it detects
in a PCP archive.  Of particular interest are wrapped values for metrics
which are expected to have monotonically increasing values.
The archive has the base name
.I archive
and must have been previously created using
.BR pmlogger (1).
.PP
Normally
.B pmlogcheck
operates on the default Performance Metrics Name Space (\c
.BR pmns (5)),
however if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative namespace is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.PP
The command line options
.B \-S
and
.B \-T
can be used to specify a time window over which metrics should be summarized.
These options are common to many Performance Co-Pilot tools and are fully
described in
.BR PCPIntro (1).
.PP
The
.B \-l
option prints the archive label, showing the log format version,
the time and date for the start and (current) end of the archive, and
the host from which the performance metrics values were collected.
.PP
By default,
.B pmlogcheck
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on the
system where
.B pmlogcheck
is run.
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (5).
The
.B \-z
option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the
host that is the source of the performance metrics, as specified in
the label record of the archive log.
.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
For each metric having ``counter'' semantics (i.e. the metric is expected to
increase monotonically) which has been detected as having wrapped at some
point in the archive,
.B pmlogcheck
produces output describing the metric name (with instance identifiers where
appropriate), the internal storage type for the metric, the value of the
metric before the counter wrap (with its associated timestamp), and the value of
the metric after the wrap (also with a timestamp).
.PP
.B pmlogcheck
produces two different timestamp formats, depending on the interval over
which it is run.  For an interval greater than 24 hours, the date is displayed
in addition to the time at which the counter wrap occurred.
If the extent of the data being checked is less than 24 hours, a more
precise format is used (time is displayed with millisecond precision, but
without the date).
.PP
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 10
.BI $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/ *
default PMNS specification files
.TP
.BI $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/ hostname
default directory for PCP archives containing performance data collected
from the host
.IR hostname .
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
