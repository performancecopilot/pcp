.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmclient
is a simple client that uses the Performance Metrics Application
Programming Interface (PMAPI) to report some high-level system
performance metrics.
.PP
The real value of
.B pmclient
is as a sample client using the
.BR PMAPI (3),
interfaces and to this end the source
code is included with
the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package (see
.BR PCPIntro (1)),
and is typically installed in
.IR /usr/share/pcp/demos/pmclient .
.PP
Normally
.B pmclient
operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
however if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.PP
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option, or to an archive by the
.B \-a
option,
.B pmclient
will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD)
on the local host to obtain the required information.  The
.B \-a
and
.B \-h
options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
By default,
.B pmclient
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on the
system where
.B pmclient
is run.
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
The
.B \-z
option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the host that
is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via either the
.B \-h
or
.B \-a
options.
.PP
Other options control the specific information to be reported.
.TP
\f3\-p\f1
The default behavior for replaying an archive, is to replay at
full speed.  The
.B \-p
option may be used in conjunction with an archive, to request that
the prevailing real-time delay be applied between samples (see
.BR \-t )
to effect a pause.
.TP
\f3\-S\f1 \f2numsec\f1
The
.B \-S
option may be used in conjunction with an archive to request that
display start at the time
.I numsec
seconds from the start of the archive.
.TP
\f3\-s\f1 \f2samples\f1
The argument
.I samples
defines the number of samples to be retrieved and reported.
If samples is 0 or
.B \-s
is not specified,
.B pmclient
will sample and report continuously (in real time mode)
or until the end of the PCP archive (in archive mode).
.TP
\f3\-t\f1 \f2interval\f1
The default update \f2interval\f1 may be set to something other than the
default 5 seconds.
The
.I interval
argument follows the syntax described in
.BR PCPIntro (1),
and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied
units in this case are seconds).
.PP
The output from
.B pmclient
is directed to standard output, and lists
.IP + 3
Aggregate CPU utilization, in the range 0 to 1.
.IP +
If the system has more than 1 CPU, the ordinal
number of the busiest CPU, in the range 0 to ...
.IP +
If the system has more than 1 CPU, the CPU utilization for the busiest CPU.
.IP +
Real free memory in Mbytes.
.IP +
Aggregate physical disk I/O operations per second (IOPS).
.IP +
Load average over the last 1 minute and over the last 15 minutes.

.B $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/pmclient
source code, documentation, configuration files and Makefile

.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
