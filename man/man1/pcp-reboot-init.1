.TH PCP-REBOOT-INIT 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pcp-reboot-init\f1 \- Performance Co-Pilot helper script after system reboot
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pcp-reboot-init
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-reboot-init
performs ``one-trip'' initialization after system reboot for the
various components of the
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).
.PP
The script is normally called from
.BR init (1)
or
.BR systemd (1)
scripts prior to starting other PCP components.
It should not need to be run at other times, but is idempotent so
repeated execution is harmless, but useless.
.PP
.B pcp-reboot-init
is intended to be run as the ``root'' user, and will fail
otherwise.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
The file
.B /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for PCP_ variables used in this script.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR init (1),
.BR PCPIntro (1),
.BR systemd (1),
.BR pcp.conf (5)
and
.BR pcp.env (5).
