.TH PMLOGMV 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmlogmv\f1 \- move (rename) Performance Co-Pilot archive files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmlogmv\f1 [\f2\-nv\f1] \f2oldname\f1 \f2newname\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of mutiple files as
created by
.BR pmlogger (1).
.B pmlogmv
allows all the files of a single PCP archive
to be moved or renamed in a single atomic
operation.
.PP
The
.I oldname
argument identifies the target archive, and may be either the basename
that is common to all files in that archive or one of the archive's
files.
The new archive's basename is
.IR newname .
.PP
The
.B \-n
option performs a dry-run, checking and reporting what changes would
be made without making any changes.
.PP
Additional reporting verbosity may be requested with the
.B \-v
option.
.PP
Because PCP archives are important records of system activity, special
care is taken to ensure the integrity of an archive's files.
Should any problem be encountered during the execution of
.BR pmlogmv ,
all the files associated with
.I oldname
will be preserved, and no new files with the
.I newname
prefix will be created.
In the event of a system crash, at least one of
.I oldname
or
.I newname
will be preserved.
.PP
The implementation of
.B pmlogmv
uses hard links in the file system and so follows the semantic
restrictions of
.IR ln (2)
which for most systems means the directories containing both
the
.I oldname
and the
.I newname
PCP archive files need to be writeable and within the
.B same
file system.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR ln (2)
and
.BR pmlogger (1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All error and warning messages are intended to be easily understood and errors
produce a non-zero exit status.
