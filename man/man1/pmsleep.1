.SH NAME
\f3pmpause\f1,
\f3pmsleep\f1 \- portable subsecond-capable sleep
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmpause
sleeps indefinitely, until interrupted by SIGKILL.
.PP
.B pmsleep
sleeps for the specified
.IR interval .
The
.I interval
argument follows the syntax described in
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for
.B \-t,
and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer
or floating point constant
(the implied units in this case are seconds).
.PP
The
.B \-w
option is provided to allow annotation of scripts with multiple
uses of
.B pmpause
and/or
.B pmsleep
to identify a particular use in the process's arguments, e.g. as
visible to
.BR ps (1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The exit status is 0 for success, or 1 for a malformed command line.
If the underlying
.BR nanosleep (2)
system call fails, an errno is returned.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR sleep (1),
.BR pause (2)
and
.BR nanosleep (2).
