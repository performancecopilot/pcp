.TH PMLOGBASENAME 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmlogbasename\f1 \- basename of a PCP archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmlogbasename\f1
\f2name\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogbasename
takes
.I name
(usually the name of one of the physical files in a PCP archive)
and strips it of any compression suffixes
then strips it of any PCP archive component suffixes,
then reports the result (the basename of a PCP archive) on standard output.
.PP
The compression suffixes known to PCP are:
.BR .xz ,
.BR .lzma ,
.BR .bz2 ,
.BR .bz ,
.BR .gz ,
.B .Z
and
.BR .z .
.PP
The PCP archive component suffixes are:
.BR .meta ,
.B .index
and
.BI . <n>
for any integer
.IR <n> .
.PP
The stripping is purely textual and
is done without tests for the existence of any of the
associated files, although if
.I name
does not match the pattern of a valid file name for a PCP archive
then the output is
.I name
without any stripping.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR PCPIntro (1)
and
.BR LOGARCHIVE (5).
