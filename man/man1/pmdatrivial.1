.TH PMDATRIVIAL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdatrivial\f1 \- trivial performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/pmdatrivial\f1
[\f3\-d\f1 \f2domain\f1]
[\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1]
[\f3\-U\f1 \f2username\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdatrivial
is the simplest possible Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
exports a single performance metric, the time
in seconds since the 1st of January, 1970.
.PP
The trivial PMDA is
shipped as source code and is designed to be an aid for PMDA developers.
.PP
A brief description of the
.B pmdatrivial
command line options follows:
.TP 5
.B \-d
It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
.I domain
number specified here is unique and consistent.
That is,
.I domain
should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
.TP
.B \-l
Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
.I trivial.log
is written in the current directory of
.BR pmcd (1)
when
.B pmdatrivial
is started, i.e.
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot
be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
.TP 5
.B \-U
User account under which to run the agent.
The default is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by default.
.SH INSTALLATION
If you want access to the names, help text and values for the trivial
performance metrics, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
.B pmdatrivial
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 10
.B $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH
command line options used to launch
.B pmdatrivial
.TP 10
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/help
default help text file for the trivial metrics
.TP 10
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Install
installation script for the
.B pmdatrivial
agent
.TP 10
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Remove
undo installation script for the
.B pmdatrivial
agent
.TP 10
.B $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/trivial.log
default log file for error messages and other information from
.B pmdatrivial
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.B /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
