.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pcp
command is used in one of two modes.
By default, it summarizes the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) installation
on the local host.
This mode can also be used to summarize the installation from a remote
.IR host ,
or a historical installation from a PCP
.IR archive .
This mode indirectly invokes the
.B pcp-summary
.I command
(in the absence of any other requested command).
.PP
Alternatively, a
.I command
can be passed to
.B pcp
to run, again possibly in the context of a remote
.I host
or historical
.IR archive .
.SH "COMMAND MODE"
When
.B pcp
is invoked with a command to run, it will search for the named
.IR command 
in
.B $PCP_BINADM_DIR
and also
.B $HOME/.pcp/bin
(these are usually scripts, and are installed with a "pcp-" prefix).
This mode of operation allows system performance tools to be
implemented using
.BR PMAPI (3)
services, while still preserving all of their usual command line
options.
These options are thus (indirectly) augmented with the standard PCP
option set, as described in
.BR PCPIntro (1).
.PP
This provides a convenient mechanism for obtaining retrospective or
remote monitoring capabilities while preserving the behaviour of the
system tools.
.PP
For example, the
.BR pcp-free (1)
utility can be invoked as follows, for recorded data from host
.IR munch :
.PP
.nf
.ft CW
$ pcp \-a $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/\fImunch\fP/20140317 \-O 11:35:50am \fBfree \-m\fP

.PP
A complete list of the available and installed tools is provided
along with the
.BR pcp (1)
usage message, but some examples include:
.BR pcp-free (1),
.BR pcp-uptime (1)
and
.BR pcp-numastat (1).
.SH "SUMMARY MODE"
The
summary report includes: the OS version, a summary of the hardware inventory,
the local timezone, the PCP software version, the state of the
.BR pmcd (1)
process and associated Performance Metrics Domain Agents
(PMDAs), as well as information about any PCP archive loggers (\c
.BR pmlogger (1))
and PCP inference engines (\c
.BR pmie (1))
that are running.
.PP
With no arguments,
.B pcp
reports on the local host, however the
following options are accepted:
.IP "\f3\-a\f1 \f2archive\f1"
Report the PCP
configuration as described in the PCP archive log
.IR archive .
.IP "\f3\-h\f1 \f2host\f1"
Report the PCP configuration on 
.I host
rather than the local host.
.IP "\f3\-n\f1 \f2pmnsfile\f1"
Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space
.RB ( pmns (5))
from the file
.IR pmnsfile .
.IP \f3\-P\f1
Display
.B pmie
performance information \- counts of rules evaluating to true, false, or
indeterminate, as well as the expected rate of rule calculation, for each
.B pmie
process running on the default host.
Refer to the individual metric help text for full details on these values.
.PP
All of the displayed values are performance
.I metric
values and further information for each can be obtained using the command:
.in 1.0i
.ft CW
.nf

$ pminfo \-dtT \f2metric\f1

.fi
.ft R
.in
The complete set of
.IR metric s
required by
.B pcp
to produce its output is contained in
.BR $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/tools/pcp-summary .
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 10
.B $HOME/.pcp/bin
Per-user location for
.I command
scripts.
.TP
.B $PCP_BINADM_DIR
System location for installed
.I command
scripts.

.B $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/tools/pcp-summary
.BR pmlogconf (1)
configuration file for collecting all of the metrics required by
.BR pcp .
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.B /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pcp 
will terminate with an exit status of 
.B 1
if 
.B pmcd
on the target host could not be reached or the archive could not be opened, 
or
.B 2
for any other error.
