.TH PMDASENDMAIL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdasendmail\f1 \- sendmail performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/pmdasendmail\f1
[\f3\-d\f1 \f2domain\f1]
[\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1]
[\f3\-U\f1 \f2username\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdasendmail
is a sendmail Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
mail traffic statistics as collected by
.BR sendmail (1).
.PP
Before the sendmail PMDA can export any metrics,
.BR sendmail (1)
must have statistics collection enabled.  This involves checking the
name of the statistics file, as given by the
.B OS
or
.B "O StatusFile"
control lines in
.BR /etc/sendmail.cf ,
and then creating this file if it does not already exist.
Removing the file will terminate statistics collection by
.BR sendmail (1)
and hence the sendmail PMDA.
.PP
A brief description of the
.B pmdasendmail
command line options follows:
.TP 5
.B \-d
It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
.I domain
number specified here is unique and consistent.
That is,
.I domain
should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
.TP
.B \-l
Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
.I sendmail.log
is written in the current directory of
.BR pmcd (1)
when
.B pmdasendmail
is started, i.e.
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot
be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
.TP 5
.B \-U
User account under which to run the agent.
The default is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by default.
.PP
There are no communication options, as the
.I Install
script ensures the sendmail PMDA will be connected to
PMCD by a pipe.
.SH INSTALLATION
If you want access to the names, help text and values for the sendmail
performance metrics, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
.B pmdasendmail
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.

used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.B /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
