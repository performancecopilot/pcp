.TH PMFIND 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmfind\f1 \- find PCP services on the network
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pmfind\f1
[\f3\-q\f1]
[\f3\-m\f1 \f2mechanism\f1]
[\f3\-s\f1 \f2service\f1]
[\f3\-r\f1]
[\f3\-t\f1 \f2timeout\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmfind
searches for instances of the specified PCP service being advertised on the
network and prints a list of URLs corresponding to the services discovered.
.PP
By default
.B pmfind
will search for all supported PCP services, however a specific PCP
.I service
to discover can be specified using the
.B \-s
(or
.BR \-\-service )
option.
Supported services are
.BR pmcd (1),
.BR pmproxy (1)
and
.BR pmwebd (1) .
.PP
The
.B \-m
(or
.BR \-\-mechanism )
option sets the
.I mechanism
that
.B pmfind
uses when performing service discovery.
By default, or if the keyword "all" is specified, every available
mechanism will be used (iteratively).
Supported mechanisms are:
.TP
.B avahi
Searches for services which are broadcasting using mDNS via
.BR avahi-daemon (8).
An optional suffix \fB",timeout=N"\fP may be added to limit the amount of
time waiting for the avahi-daemon. N is a floating point number
specifying the number of seconds to wait.
The default is 0.5 seconds.
This timeout may also be specified by setting the environment variable
.B AVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT
to the desired number of seconds.
If both are specified, then
the value specified in the environment variable takes precedence.
.TP
.B probe=<net-address>/<mask-bits>
Actively probes the given subnet for the requested PCP service(s).
<net-address> is an inet or ipv6
network address and <mask-bits> is the number of bits used to define the
subnet.
For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an 8 bit subnet consisting of the
addresses 192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255.
An optional suffix \fB",maxThreads=N"\fP may be added to limit the number of
threads used while probing.
The default is the value of FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) or the
number of addresses in the subnet, whichever is less.
An optional suffix \fB",timeout=N"\fP may be added to limit the amount of
time spent waiting for each connection attempt.
N is a floating point number specifying the number of seconds to wait.
The default is 0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds).
.TP
.B shell
Probes the list of addresses provided by scripts for requested PCP service(s).
Several optional, comma-separated parameters can also be provided.
The \fB"path=DIR"\fP option specifies the directory where commands like
.BR pcp-kube-pods (1)
are located (defaults to
.IR "$PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover/" ).
This setting can be further restricted to an individual command
using the \fBcommand=CMD\fP option, but the default is to use all
available commands from the \fBpath\fP.
The \fB"maxThreads=N"\fP option limits the number of threads used while
probing.
The default is the value of FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) or the
number of addresses returned by the scripts, whichever is less.
The \fB"timeout=N"\fP option may be added to limit the amount of
time spent waiting for each connection attempt.
N is a floating point number specifying the number of seconds to wait.
The default is 0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds).
.PP
The
.B \-r
(or
.BR \-\-resolve )
option requests that DNS name resolution be attempted for the addresses of
any discovered services.
The default is to display the network addresses of any discovered services.
.PP
The
.B \-t
(or
.BR \-\-timeout )
option sets the maximum amount of time that
.B pmfind
will take before interrupting the service discovery. The argument is a floating
point number representing the number of seconds before timing out. The default
is to take as much time as is needed to complete the process.
.PP
The
.B \-q
(or
.BR \-\-quiet )
option suppresses all output on the standard output stream.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 10
.BI $PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover
default path to address discovery scripts
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The value of the exit status from the command is zero when services were
successfully located, one if no services were found, and two if an error
occurred.
.PP
In the event of an error, a message will be generated on standard error
that is intended to be self-explanatory.
.SH SIGNALS
.B pmfind
will interrupt the service discovery process when one of the following
signals is received: SIGHUP, SIGPIPE, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGXFSZ, SIGXCPU.
.B pmfind
will report any results which were discovered up to point of the interruption.
