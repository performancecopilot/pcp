.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmlogreduce
reads one set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives
identified by
.I input
and creates a temporally reduced PCP archive in
.IR output .
.I input
is a comma-separated list of names, each
of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
one or more archives.
The
data reduction involves statistical and temporal reduction of samples with
an output sampling
interval defined by the
.B \-t
option in the
.I output
archive (independent of the sampling intervals in the
.I input
archives), and is further controlled by
other command line arguments.
.PP
For some metrics, temporal data reduction is not going to be helpful,
so for metrics with types
.B PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE
or
.BR PM_TYPE_EVENT ,
a warning is issued if these metrics are found in
.I input
and they will be skipped and not appear in the
.I output
archive.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-A\fR \fIalign\fR, \fB\-\-align\fR=\fIalign\fR
Specify a ``natural'' alignment of the output sample times; refer
to
.BR PCPIntro (1).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIsamples\fR, \fB\-\-samples\fR=\fIsamples\fR
The argument
.I samples
defines the number of samples to be written to
.IR output .
If
.I samples
is 0 or
.B -s
is not specified,
.B pmlogreduce
will sample until the end of the set of PCP archives,
or the end of the time window as specified by
.BR -T ,
whichever comes first.
The
.B -s
option will override the
.B -T
option if it occurs sooner.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR \fIstarttime\fR, \fB\-\-start\fR=\fIstarttime\fR
Define the start of a time window to restrict the samples retrieved
from the
.I input
archives; refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1).
.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fIinterval\fR, \fB\-\-interval\fR=\fIinterval\fR
Consecutive samples in the
.I output
archive will appear with a time delta defined by
.IR interval ;
refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1).
Note the default value is 600 (seconds, i.e. 10 minutes).
.TP
\fB\-T\fR \fIendtime\fR, \fB\-\-finish\fR=\fIendtime\fR
Define the termination of a time window to restrict the samples
retrieved from the
.I input
archives; refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1).
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fIvolsamples\fR
The
.I output
archive is potentially a multi-volume data set, and the
.B \-v
option causes
.B pmlogreduce
to start a new volume after
.I volsamples
records have been written to the
.I output
archive.
.RS 7
.PP
Independent of any
.B \-v
option, each volume of an archive is limited to no more than
2^31 bytes, so
.I pmlogreduce
will automatically create a new volume for the archive before
this limit is reached.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-hostzone\fR
Use the local timezone of the host from the
.I input
archives when displaying the date and time, or interpreting the
.B \-S
and
.B \-T
options.
The default is to initially use the timezone of the local host.
.TP
\fB\-Z\fR \fItimezone\fR, \fB\-\-timezone\fR=\fItimezone\fR
Use
.I timezone
when displaying the date and time, or interpreting the
.B \-S
and
.B \-T
options.
.I Timezone
is in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH DATA REDUCTION
The statistical and temporal reduction follows the following rules:
.TP 4m
1.
Consecutive records from
.I input
are read without interpolation, and at most one output record
is written for each
.IR interval ,
summarizing the performance data over that period.
.TP 4m
2.
If the semantics of a metric indicates it is
.B instantaneous
or
.B discrete
then
.I output
value is computed as the arithmetic mean of the observations (if any)
over each
.IR interval .
.TP 4m
3.
If the semantics of a metric indicates it is a
.B counter
then the following transformations are applied:
.RS +4m
.nr PD 0
.TP 4m
a)
Metrics with 32-bit precision are promoted to 64-bit precision.
.TP 4m
b)
Any counter wrap (overflow) is noted, and appropriate adjustment made
in the value of the metric over each
.IR interval .
This will be correct in the case of a single counter wrap, but will
silently
.B underestimate
in the case where more than one counter wrap occurs between consecutive
observations in the
.I input
archives, and silently
.B overestimate
in the case where a counter reset occurs between consecutive
observations in the
.I input
archives; unfortunately these situations cannot be detected, but
are believed to be rare events for the sort of production monitoring
environments where
.B pmlogreduce
is most likely to be deployed.
.RE
.PD
.TP 4m
4.
Any changes in instance domains, and indeed all metadata, is preserved.
.TP 4m
5.
Any ``mark'' records in the
.I input
archives (as created by
.BR pmlogextract (1))
will be preserved in the
.I output
archive, so periods where no data is available are maintained, and data
interpolation will
.B not
occur across these periods when the
.I output
archive is subsequently processed with PCP applications.
.SH CAVEATS
The preamble metrics (pmcd.pmlogger.archive, pmcd.pmlogger.host,
and pmcd.pmlogger.port), which are automatically recorded by
.B pmlogger
at the start of the archive, may not be present in the archive output by
.BR pmlogreduce .
These metrics are only relevant while the archive is being created,
and have no significance once recording has finished.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All error conditions detected by
.B pmlogreduce
are reported on
.I stderr
with textual (if sometimes terse) explanation.
.PP
Should the
.I input
archives be corrupted (this can happen
if the
.B pmlogger
instance writing the archive suddenly dies), then
.B pmlogreduce
will detect and report the position of the corruption in the file,
and any subsequent information from the
.I input
archives will not be processed.
.PP
If any error is detected,
.B pmlogreduce
will exit with a non-zero status.
.SH FILES
For each of the
.I input
and
.I output
archives, several physical files are used.
.TP 5
\f2archive\f3.meta
metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for the archive
.TP
\f2archive\f3.0
initial volume of metrics values (subsequent volumes have suffixes
.BR 1 ,
.BR 2 ,
\&...) \- for
.I input
these files may have been previously compressed with
.BR bzip2 (1)
or
.BR gzip (1)
and thus may have an additional
.B .bz2
or
.B .gz
suffix.
.TP
\f2archive\f3.index
temporal index to support rapid random access to the other files in the
archive.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
