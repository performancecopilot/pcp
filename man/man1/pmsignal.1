.TH PMSIGNAL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmsignal\f1 \- send a signal to one or more processes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsignal\f1
[\f3\-a\f1|\f3-l\f1]
[\f3\-n\f1]
[\f3\-s\f1 \fIsignal\fR]
[\f2PID\f1 ...|\f2name\f1 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmsignal
provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for use with
tools from the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit.
It can be used to send a named
.I signal
(only HUP, USR1, TERM, and KILL are accepted).
to one or more processes.
The processes are specified using PID or the binary name (with
.B \-a
option).
.PP
If a
.I signal
is not specified, then the TERM signal will be sent.
.PP
On Linux and UNIX platforms,
.I pmsignal
is a simple wrapper around the
.IR kill (1)
command.
On Windows, the is no direct equivalent to this mechanism, and
so an alternate mechanism has been implemented \- this is only
honoured by PCP tools, however, not all Windows utilities.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR kill (1),
.BR killall (1),
.BR pcp.conf (5)
and
.BR pcp.env (5).
