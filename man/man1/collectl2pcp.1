.TH COLLECTL2PCP 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3collectl2pcp\f1 \- import collectl data to a PCP archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3collectl2pcp\f1
[\f3\-F\f1]
[\f3\-v\f1]
[\f3\-?\f1]
\f2file\f1
[\f2file\f1 ...]
\f2archive\f1

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B collectl2pcp
reads raw
.BR collectl (1)
data from each \f2file\f1
and creates a new PCP archive with basename \f2archive\f1.
Each input \f2file\f1 may be gzipped (with \f3.gz\f1 suffix).
The PCP \f2archive\f1 and at least one input \f2file\fP are required arguments.
.PP
The options to
.B collectl2pcp
are as follows.
.TP
\f3\-F\f1
Overwrite \f2archive\fP (and the index and meta files) if it already exists.
.TP
\f3\-v\f1
Report progress and errors verbosely.
This also reports a count of unsupported metric data in the
.BR collectl (1)
input file(s),
which is normally silently skipped.
.TP
\f2file\f1 [\f2file\f1 ...]
These are the
.BR collectl (1)
input files.
If more than one is given,
they must contain data for the same host and be given in
time-stamp chronological order on the command line.
Note that when
.BR collectl (1)
is run as a service,
it normally creates files with date based names that will sort chronologically
(e.g. \f3/var/log/collectl/*.gz\f1 will be sorted correctly).
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).

.BR pmcollectl (1),

.BR LOGIMPORT (3),
