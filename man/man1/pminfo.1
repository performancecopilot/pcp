.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pminfo
displays various types of information about performance metrics
available through the facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).
.PP
Normally
.B pminfo
operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however
if the
.B \-n
option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded
from the file
.IR pmnsfile.
The
.B \-N
option supports the same function as
.BR \-n ,
except for the handling of
duplicate names for the same Performance Metric Identifier (PMID) in
.I pmnsfile
\- duplicate names are allowed with
.B \-n
they are not allowed with
.BR \-N .
.PP
The metrics of interest are named in the
.I metricname
arguments.
If
.I metricname
is a non-leaf node in the PMNS, then
.B pminfo
will recursively descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes.
If no
.I metricname
argument is given, the root of the PMNS is used.
.PP
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option, by default
.B pminfo
will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
(PMCD) on the local host.
The connection to a PMCD is only required if
.B pminfo
requires distributed PMNS information, and/or meta-data
describing metrics, and/or metric values, and/or help text.
.PP
The
.B \-a
option causes
.B pminfo
to use the specified set of archives rather than connecting to a PMCD.
The argument to
.B \-a
is a comma-separated list of names, each
of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
one or more archives.
The
.B \-a , \-h
and
.B \-L
options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
The
.B \-L
option causes
.B pminfo
to use a local context to collect metrics from PMDAs on the local host
without PMCD.  Only some metrics are available in this mode.
The
.BR \-a , \-h
and
.B \-L
options are mutually exclusive.
.PP
The
.B \-b
option may be used to define the maximum size of the group of metrics to
be fetched in a single request for the
.B \-f
and
.B \-v
options.  The default value for
.I batchsize
is 128.
.PP
Other options control the specific information to be reported.
.TP 5
.B \-c
The
.I dmfile
argument specifies a file that contains derived metric definitions
in the format described for
.BR pmLoadDerivedConfig (3).
The
.B \-c
option provides a way to load derived metric definitions
that is an alternative to the more generic use of the
.B PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG
environment variable as described in
.BR PCPIntro (1).
Using the
.B \-c
option and the
.B PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG
environment variable to specify the
.B same
configuration is a bad idea, so choose one or the other method.
.TP
.B \-d
Metric descriptions detailing the PMID, data type, data semantics, units,
scale and associated instance domain.
.TP
.B \-f
Fetch and print values for all instances.
When fetching from a set if archives, only
those instances present in the first archive record for a metric will be
displayed; see also the
.B \-O
option, else use
.BR pmdumplog (1)
which may be a better tool for examining archives.
.TP
.B \-F
Same as
.B \-f
but try harder to fetch instances for metrics which have non-enumerable
instance domains (e.g. metrics in the ``proc'' subtree of the default
PMNS).
.TP
.B \-K
When using the
.B \-L
option to fetch metrics from a local context, the
.B \-K
option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
made accessible.  The
.I spec
argument conforms to the syntax described in
.BR __pmSpecLocalPMDA (3).
More than one
.B \-K
option may be used.
.TP
.B \-m
Print the PMID in terse mode.
.TP
.B \-M
Print the PMID in verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-O
When used in conjunction with an archive source of metrics and
the options
.B \-f
or
.BR \-F ,
the
.I time
argument defines a time origin at which the metrics should be
fetched from the set of archives.
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of this option, and the syntax for the
.I time
argument.
.TP
.B \-t
Print the ``one line'' help summary, if available.
.TP
.B \-T
Print the help text, if available.
.TP
.B \-v
Verify mode in which descriptions and values are retrieved, but only
error conditions are reported.  This option silently disables any
output from the options
.BR \-f ,
.BR \-M ,
.BR \-m ,
.B \-t
and
.BR \-T .
.TP
.B \-x
Like the
.B \-f
option, but with the additional functionality that if a value is
processed that is of type PM_TYPE_EVENT, then the event records
will be unpacked and the details of each event record reported.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 10
.BI $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/ *
default local PMNS specification files
.PD
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
