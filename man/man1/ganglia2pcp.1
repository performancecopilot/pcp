.TH GANGLIA2PCP 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3ganglia2pcp\f1 \- import ganglia data and create a PCP archive

[\fB\-e\fR \fIend\fR]
[\fB\-f\fR \fIoutfile\fR]
[\fB\-h\fR \fIhostname\fR]

[\fB\-Z\fR \fItimezone\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\&\fBganglia2pcp\fR is intended to read a set of ganglia files stored in the
rrd format
and translate them into a Performance
Co-Pilot (\s-1PCP\s0) archive with the basename \fIoutfile\fR.
.PP
The intent of this converter is to take all of the rrd files found in the input_dir
and generate a single pcp archive file.
The mapping of ganglia metrics to pcp metrics is defined internally.
.PP
The resultant \s-1PCP\s0 achive may be used with all the \s-1PCP\s0 client tools
to graph subsets of the data using \fBpmchart\fR(1),
perform data reduction and reporting, filter with
the \s-1PCP\s0 inference engine \fBpmie\fR(1), etc.
.PP
A series of physical files will be created with the prefix \fIoutfile\fR.
These are \fIoutfile\fR\fB.0\fR (the performance data),
\&\fIoutfile\fR\fB.meta\fR (the metadata that describes the performance data) and
\&\fIoutfile\fR\fB.index\fR (a temporal index to improve efficiency of replay
operations for the archive).
If any of these files exists already,
then \fBsar2pcp\fR will \fBnot\fR overwrite them and will exit with an error
message of the form
.PP
__pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written
.PP
\&\fBganglia2pcp\fR is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl wrapper
around the \s-1PCP\s0 \fIlibpcp_import\fR
library, and as such could be used as an example to develop new
tools to import other types of performance data and create \s-1PCP\s0 archives.
The RRDs Perl wrapper is used to parse the raw rrd format files.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-d\fR \fIoutdir\fR
The
.I outdir
argument specifies a output to write to.
The default is the current directory.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fIend\fR
The
.I end
argument specifies a end time in a format understood by str2time.
The default start time is current time.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIoutfile\fR
The
.I outfile
argument specifies a output file name.
The default name is in the standard pmlogger format based on the start time,
e.g., 20150201.00.10.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fIhostname\fR
The
.I hostname
argument specifies a hostname to write to the archive.
The default is taken from the directory name that the rrd files reside in.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIstart\fR
The
.I start
argument specifies a start time in a format understood by str2time.
The default start time is 24 prior to current time.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR \fIversion\fR
The
.B \-V
option specifies the version for the output PCP archive.
By default the archive version
.B $PCP_ARCHIVE_VERSION
(set to 3 in current PCP releases)
is used, and the only values
currently supported for
.I version
are 2 or 3.
.TP
\fB\-Z\fR \fItimezone\fR
The
.I timezone
argument sets the source timezone in the \s-1PCP\s0 archive (the
default is to use the local timezone).
The timezone must have the format +HHMM (for hours and minutes East of \s-1UTC\s0)
or \-HHMM (for hours and minutes West of \s-1UTC\s0) or \s-1UTC\s0.
Note in particular that \fBneither\fR the \fBzoneinfo\fR
(aka Olson) format, e.g. Europe/Paris, nor the Posix \fB\s-1TZ\s0\fR format, e.g.
\&\s-1EST+5\s0 is allowed.
Example: timezone=``+1100''.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
