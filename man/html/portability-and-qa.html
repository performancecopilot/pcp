<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In this document the generic term &quot;component&quot; will be used to describe a piece of
functionality in Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) that could be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a library</li>
<li>a method or module or class in a library</li>
<li>an application</li>
<li>a PMDA</li>
<li>a service or API</li>
<li>an object in the file system</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously the functional goals and feature focus of PCP has been to build tools that help understand hard performance problems
that are seen in some the the world's most complex systems.
Over more than two decades, the delivery of components to address the feature requirements
has been build on engineering processes and approaches with a technical focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Portability</b>:

<p>From the outset we were concerned with making PCP work successfully across a wide variety of environments.</p>
<p>The earliest PCP architectural deliberations began at Pyramid Technology in 1993,
but by this time I had already been working on portable software for more than 15 years.
Then the PCP incubator moved to SGI, and in the very early days of Linux, Mark Goodwin undertook an
&quot;IRIX to Linux&quot; port as a skunkworks project within SGI Engineering.
A little later, SGI's Clustered File System (CXFS) had PCP components for IRIX, Windows, HP-UX, AIX, MacOS and Linux,
across a variety of CPU architectures, C compilers and operating systems.</p>
<p>Although many of these have passed away, PCP survives and is now actively supported on all Linux
variants (most importantly the Fedora/RPM, OpenSuSE/RPM and Debian/dpkg platforms and their respective derivatives),
the BSD family, OpenIndiana (<i>nee</i> Sun Solaris), Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
<p>So there is a very rich history of engineering for portability in the PCP DNA, and an expectation that new
PCP components will be &quot;robust&quot; (see below for a definition of &quot;robust&quot;) across all of the
supported platforms and environments.</p>

</li>
<li><b>Testability</b>:

<p>The PCP project has never had a dedicated QA team, so by necessity the QA model that was adopted (and at times enforced)
was one where if an engineer added a feature or fixed a bug, there was an expectation that there would be
additional QA coverage for the associated changes.
Although this approach suffers from tunnel-vision and common assumptions between development and testing,
it does have the advantage that testing and QA is a communal responsibility.
</p>
<p>This effort grew into the very large QA infrastructure that lives below the <i>qa</i> directory in the source
tree and is shipped in the <b>pcp-testsuite</b> package.  This represents a significant engineering
effort in its own right as the table below shows:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>below the src dir</th><th>below the qa dir</th></tr>
    <tr><td>C or C++</td><td>320,000</td><td>37,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>shell</td><td>23,000</td><td>85,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>perl</td><td>18,000</td><td>700</td></tr>
    <tr><td>python</td><td>17,000</td><td>200</td></tr>
<caption>Lines of Code</caption>
</table>

<p>The QA testsuite comprises close to 1,100 test scripts.
The scripts are used by individual developers to test code changes and check for regressions.
In addition the entire suite of scripts is run regularly across the 30+ machines in the Melbourne QA Farm.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Robustness</h2>

<p>Robustness simply means that every PCP application and service either works correctly or
detects that the environment will not support correct execution and is either omitted from the build
or omitted from the packaging
or reports a warning and exits in an orderly fashion.</p>

<p>Some examples may help illustrate this philosophy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The platform PMDAs (linux, windows, freebsd, openbsd, netbsd, opensolaris, aix, ...) are only compiled and
packaged if the build is being run for the corresponding target platform.</li>
<li>Optional headers are checked for using the <i>AC_CHECK_HEADERS</i>() macro in 
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/configure.ac">configure.ac</a> and <i>cpp</i> conditionals
and macros are used to guard the inclusion of these headers, e.g. &lt;strings.h&gt; in 
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/src/dbpmda/src/util.c">src/dbpmda/src/util.c</a>.</li>
<li>In the Apple operating systems there used to be a rpc.server.nqnfs.leases metric but this has been deprecated
and is no longer available.
The corresponding darwin PMDA uses PMAPI protocols to return the type of this metric as <b>PM_TYPE_NOSUPPORT</b> which
all PCP clients are able to handle appropriately (either ignore the metric or report an explanatory warning).
See <a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/src/pmdas/darwin/pmda.c">src/pmdas/darwin/pmda.c</a></li>
<li>Every PCP QA test script completes with a status of pass, fail or notrun.
The latter is used to indicate that the test either cannot be run because some required component is missing or
the test is not appropriate for the current platform.
See the tests for the Python <b>OrderedDict</b> module and the <i>pmrep</i> application in 
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/qa/035">qa/035</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Source Code and Compile Time Portability</h2>

<p>Mostly what's been done here is common and good engineering practice.
For example using configure, conditionals in the GNUmakefiles and assorted <i>sed</i>/<i>awk</i> rewriting
scripts to ensure the code will compile cleanly on all platforms.
Compiler warnings are enabled and builds are expected to complete without warnings.
And in the source code we demand thorough error checking and error handling on all system and library calls.</p>

<p>We've extended the normal concept of macros to include a set of globally defined names
that are are used for path and directory names, search paths, application names and application options and
arguments.
These are defined in
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/src/include/pcp.conf.in">src/include/pcp.conf.in</a>,
bound to values at build time by configure and installed in /etc/pcp.conf.
These can then be used either from shell scripts or applications in C, C++, Perl, Python
have run-time access to these via <i>pmGetConfig</i>() or <i>pmGetOptionalConfig</i>(), see for example
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/src/pmie/src/pmie.c">src/pmie/src/pmie.c</a>.</p>

<p>Even file pathname separators (/ for the sane world, \ elsewhere) have been abstracted out and <i>pmPathSeparator</i>() is
used to construct pathnames from directory components.</p>

<p>At a higher level we don't even try to build code if it is not intended for the target platform.</p>

<h2>Packaging Portability</h2>

<p>At packaging time we use conditionals to include only those components that are expected to work
for the target platform.</p>

<p>This extends to wrapping some of the prerequites in conditionals if the prequisite piece may not be
present or may have a different name.</p>

<p>For Debian packaging this means debian/control is build from
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/debian/control.master">debian/control.master</a>
and the ?{foo} elements of the
<b>Depends</b> and <b>Build-Depends</b> clauses are conditionally expanded by the
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/debian/fixcontrol.master">debian/fixcontrol.master</a>
script during the build.</p>

<p>For RPM packaging this means using configure to perform macro substitution to create build/rpm/pcp.spec from
<a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/pcp/blob/master/build/rpm/pcp.spec.in">build/rpm/pcp.spec.in</a>
and using %if within the spec file to selectively include packages and adjust the <b>BuildRequires</b> and <b>Requires</b> clauses.</p>

<h2>QA Portability</h2>

<p>All this section is still TODO, but will cover at least</p>
<p>QA applications source code should follow all of the same guidelines as those that apply for
the applications and libraries that ship with the main part of PCP.
The only possible exception is that error handling can be a little more relaxed for the QA programs as they are
only run in a more controlled environment.
<h3>Use /etc/pcp.conf</h3>
<ul>
<li>$PCP_*</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use the Predefined Variables</h3>
<ul>
<li>$seq</li>
<li>$tmp</li>
<li>$sudo</li>
</ul>
<h3>Avoid exotic commands and non-standard command arguments</h3>
<p>Our tests scripts are run with <b>sh</b> not <b>bash</b> and on some platforms these are really different!
Things like: [ "$foo" == "bar" ] or any use of [[ ... ]] are going to blow up when presented to a real Bourne shell.</p>
<p>Another recurring one is the <i>-i</i> argument for <b>sed</b>; this is not standard and not supported everywhere
so just do not use it. The alternative:<br>
<code>$ sed ... <file >$tmp.tmp; mv $tmp.tmp file</code><br>
works everywhere for most of the cases in QA, except possibly if permissions are in play, when you may need:<br>
<code>$ sed ... <file >$tmp.tmp; $sudo cp $tmp.tmp file; rm $tmp.tmp</code></p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<h3>Not Run</h3>
<h3>PMNS Order</h3>
<h3>Instance Order</h3>
<h3>Sort Order</h3>
<h3>Filesystem Directory Order</h3>
<h3>Alternate .out files</h3>
<ul>
<li>PMNS Differences (especially for the kernel PMDA)</li>
<li>Hashing Differences</li>
<li>Word Size</li>
<li>Endianness</li>
</ul>
