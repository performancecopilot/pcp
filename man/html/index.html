	<p>
	This example demonstrates how to use Qt Assistant as help system
	for your own application. You can control Qt Assistant either directly
	using e.g. the open button or indirectly by pressing F1.
	</p>

	<p>
	This example provides a context sensitive help, i.e. pressing F1 will
	show the help for the item under the mouse cursor.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In order to run Qt Assistant as a custom help tool for this
	application properly you have to specify a profile. A profile
	is a file format similar to the documentation content files
	that assistant used up to Qt 3.1. Once such a profile has been
	specified Qt Assistant can be run with the option <code>-profile</code>
	and then the filename of the profile. The HelpDemo example does
	this for you if you press the <i>Run Qt Assistant customized for
	HelpDemo</i>. 
	</p>

	<p>	
	Qt Assistant can also display arbitrary pages with the
	<i>Display</i> button or using the context help (F1), but Qt
	Assistant won't be customized for this example application.
