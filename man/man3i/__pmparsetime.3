.SH CAVEAT
This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) developer use.
.PP
These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed to
remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may provide
different semantics at some point in the future.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B __pmParseTime
and
.B __pmParseHighResTime
are designed to encapsulate the interpretation of a time point specification
in command line switches for use by the PCP client tools.
.P
These functions expects to be called with the time point specification as
.BR string .
If the tool is running against PCP archive(s), you also
need to supply the start time of the first (only) archive as
.BR logStart ,
and the end of the last (only) archive as
.BR logEnd .
See
.BR pmGetArchiveLabel (3)
and
.BR pmGetArchiveEnd (3)
for how to obtain values for these parameters.
If the tool is running against a live feed of performance data,
.B logStart
should be the current time (but could be aligned on the next second
for example), while
.B logEnd
should have its tv_sec component set to PM_MAX_TIME_T.
.P
The
.B rslt
structure must be allocated before either calling
.B __pmParseTime
or
.BR __pmParseHighResTime .
.P
You also need to set the current PCP reporting time zone to correctly
reflect the \-z and \-Z command line parameters before calling
.B __pmParseTime
or
.BR __pmParseHighResTime .
See
.BR pmUseZone (3)
and friends for information on how this is done.
.P
If the conversion is successful, both
.B __pmParseTime
and
.B __pmParseHighResTime
return 0, and fill in
.B rslt
with the time value defined by the input parameters.
If the argument strings could not be parsed, it returns \-1
and a dynamically allocated error message string in
.BR errMsg .
Be sure to
.BR free (3)
this error message string.
