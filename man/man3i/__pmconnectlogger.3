.SH CAVEAT
This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) developer use.
.PP
These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed to
remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may provide
different semantics at some point in the future.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CR
.ie t \f(CR\\$1\fR\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\fR\\$2
..
Each instance of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive creation program
.BR pmlogger (1)
supports a control port on which
.BR __pmControlLog (3)
requests are received, and responses sent.
Optionally, the
.BR pmlogger (1)
instance may be designated the ``primary'' logger.
.PP
.B __pmConnectLogger
may be used to establish a control port connection to the
.BR pmlogger (1)
instance identified by process id
.I pid
on the host
.IR hostname .
.PP
One special case is supported; for the reserved
.I pid
value of
.B PM_LOG_PRIMARY_PORT
the requested connection is to the
control port for the ``primary'' logger, whatever its process
id might be.
.PP
On success,
.B __pmConnectLogger
returns a non-negative integer, that is a file descriptor that may be used
in subsequent communication with the
.BR pmlogger (1)
instance, e.g. for
.BR __pmControlLog (3).
.PP
As the control port to
.BR pmlogger (1)
is not multiplexed, applications using
.B __pmConnectLogger
should use
.BR close (2)
to terminate the connection to
.BR pmlogger (1)
as soon as they have finished communicating.
.PP
If the application connects, and the
.BR pmlogger (1)
instance subsequently terminates, e.g. \c
because the associated
.BR pmcd (1)
instance is terminated, the application will have to explicitly
re-establish connection to a re-started
.BR pmlogger (1)
instance by calling
.B __pmConnectLogger
again.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_PERMISSION\f1
no permission to connect to the specified
.BR pmlogger (1)
instance
.IP \f3\-ECONNREFUSED\f1
the designated
.BR pmlogger (1)
instance does not exist
.IP \f3\-EADDRINUSE\f1
the requested control port is already in use
