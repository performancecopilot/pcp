.SH CAVEAT
This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) developer use.
.PP
These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed to
remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may provide
different semantics at some point in the future.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B __pmMktime
is very similar to
.BR mktime (3),
except the timezone used is the current ``reporting timezone'' (rather than the
default
.B TZ
environment variable scheme).
.PP
Like
.BR mktime (3)
the time to be converted is passed via
.IR timeptr ,
and
the function result
contains the calendar time (the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC,
January 1, 1970).
.PP
The default current reporting timezone is as defined by the
.B TZ
environment variable, so
.B __pmMktime
and
.BR mktime (3)
will initially produce similar conversions.
.PP
Use
.BR pmNewZone (3),
.BR pmNewContextZone (3)
or
.BR pmUseZone (3)
to establish a new current reporting timezone that will effect
.B __pmMktime
but not
.BR mktime (3).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR mktime (3),
.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmCtime (3),
.BR pmLocaltime (3),
.BR pmNewContextZone (3),
.BR pmNewZone (3)
and
.BR pmUseZone (3).
