.TH PCP.ENV 5 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pcp.env\f1 \- script to set Performance Co-Pilot run-time environment variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/pcp.env
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I pcp.env
script is sourced by assorted Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) scripts
and utilities to define the PCP operating environment variables.
The conjugate for executable programs using the PCP libraries is the
.IR pmGetConfig (3)
function.
.PP
Typical usage of
.I pcp.env
in a script is as follows :
.IP
  #! /bin/sh

  # source the PCP environment variables
  . /etc/pcp.env
  rest of script ...

.PP
The full syntax and semantics of the
.I pcp.conf
file and the
.I pmGetConfig
function are described in their respective reference pages.
.PP
If the file
.I $HOME/.pcp/pcp.conf
exists then this will be processed after the system-wide
.I pcp.conf
file.
This provides a mechanism to selectively modify or augment
the environment settings for PCP scripts, which maybe useful
if the scripts are run with
.BR sudo (1)
which cleans the environment of important settings
that are required to ensure the correct execution of the PCP scripts,
e.g.
.B $PATH
or
.BR $PERL5LIB .
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B PCP_CONF
environment variable specifies an alternative path to the
.I pcp.conf
file.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR PCPIntro (1),
.BR sudo (1),
.BR PCPIntro (3),
.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmGetConfig (3)
and
.BR pcp.conf (5).
