..
When processing event records, if
.BR pmUnpackEventRecords (3)
is used to unpack event records from a metric within a
.I pmResult
structure with a value of type
.B PM_TYPE_EVENT
then the structure returned from
.BR pmUnpackEventRecords (3)
is a NULL pointer terminated array of pointers to
.I pmResult
structures, one for each event record.
.PP
.B pmFreeEventResult
is a convenience method that frees all of the
.I pmResult
structures and the array of pointers (\c
.IR rset ).
.PP
Similarly,
.B pmFreeHighResEventResult
may be used to free the
.I pmHighResResult
structures and array returned from the
.BR pmUnpackHighResEventRecords
routine when using
.BR PM_TYPE_HIGHRES_EVENT
metrics.

.BR PMAPI (3)
