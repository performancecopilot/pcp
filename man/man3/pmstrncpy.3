.TH PMSTRNCPY 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmstrncpy\f1 \- safe string copy
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
int pmstrncpy(char *\fIdest\fP, size_t \fIdestlen\fP, char *\fIsrc\fP);
.sp
cc ... \-lpcp
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmstrncpy
is safe string copying routine with semantics similar to
.BR strncpy (3).
.PP
The main differences are that
.I src
must be null-byte terminated,
.I destlen
is the length of the destination buffer (\c
.IR dest )
not the length of the source string (\c
.IR src ),
and
.B pmstrncpy
ensures that
.I dest
is null-byte terminated, even when \fIstrlen\fP(\fIsrc\fP) is larger
than
.IR destlen .
.PP
On success,
.B pmstrncpy
returns 0, else -1 indicates that
.I src
is too big and the result been truncated to ensure
.I dest
has no been overrun.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR pmstrncat (3)
and
.BR strncpy (3).
