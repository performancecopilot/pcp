.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmParseTimeWindow
is designed to encapsulate the interpretation of the 
.BR \-S ,
.BR \-T ,
.B \-A
and
.B \-O
command line options used by Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) applications
to define a time window of interest.
The time window is defined by a start time and an end time that constrains
the time interval during which the PCP application will retrieve and
display performance metrics.  In the absence of the
.B \-O
and
.B \-A
options to specify an initial sample time origin
and time alignment (see below), the PCP application
will retrieve the first sample at the start of the time window.
.P
The syntax and meaning of the various argument formats for these options
is described in
.BR PCPIntro (1).
.SH USAGE
.B pmParseTimeWindow
expects to be called with the argument of the
.B \-S
option as
.BR swStart ,
the argument of the
.B \-T
option as
.BR swEnd ,
the argument of the
.B \-A
option as
.BR swAlign ,
and the argument of the
.B \-O
option as
.BR swOffset .
Any or all of these parameters may be NULL
to indicate that the corresponding command line option was not
present.
.P
If the application is using a set of PCP archive logs as the source
of performance metrics, you also
need to supply the time of the first archive log entry as
.BR logStart ,
and the time of the last archive log entry as
.BR logEnd .
See
.BR pmGetArchiveLabel (3)
and
.BR pmGetArchiveEnd (3)
for how to obtain values for these times.
.P
If the application is manipulating multiple concurrent archive
logs, then the caller must resolve how the default time window
is to be defined (the union of the time intervals in all archive
logs is a likely interpretation).
.P
If the application is using a live feed of performance data,
.B logStart
should be the current time (but could be aligned on the next second
for example), while
.B logEnd
should have its
.I tv_sec
component set to
.BR INT_MAX .
.P
The
.BR rsltStart ,
.B rsltEnd
and
.B rsltOffset
structures must be allocated before calling
.BR pmParseTimeWindow .
.P
You also need to set the current PCP reporting time zone to correctly
reflect the
.B \-z
and
.B \-Z
command line parameters before calling
.BR pmParseTimeWindow .
See
.BR pmUseZone (3)
and friends for information on how this is done.

.BR pmNewContextZone (3),

and
.BR pmUseZone (3).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the conversion is successful,
.B pmParseTimeWindow
returns 1 and fills in
.BR rsltStart ,
.B rsltEnd
and
.B rsltOffset
with the start, end, and offset times for the time window defined by the input
parameters.  
The
.B errMsg
parameter is not changed when
.BR pmParseTimeWindow
returns 1.
.P
If the conversion is successful, but the requested alignment could not be
performed (e.g. the set of PCP archive logs is too short) the alignment is
ignored,
.BR rsltStart ,
.B rsltEnd
and
.B rsltOffset
are filled in and
.BR pmParseTimeWindow
returns 0.
In this case,
.B errMsg
will point to a warning message in a dynamically allocated buffer.
The caller is responsible for releasing the buffer by calling
.BR free (3).
.P
If the argument strings could not be parsed,
.B pmParseTimeWindow
returns \-1.
In this case,
.BR errMsg
will point to an error message
in a dynamically allocated buffer.
The caller is responsible for releasing the buffer by calling
.BR free (3).
