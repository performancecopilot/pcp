.TH PMCTIME 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmCtime\f1 \- format the date and time for a reporting timezone
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <time.h>
.br
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
char *pmCtime(const time_t *\fIclock\fP, char *\fIbuf\fP);
.sp
cc ... \-lpcp
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmCtime
is very similar to
.BR ctime (3),
except the timezone used is the current ``reporting timezone'' (rather than the
default
.B TZ
environment variable scheme), and the result is returned into a
caller-declared buffer (rather than a private buffer).
.PP
Like
.BR ctime (3)
the time to be converted is passed via
.IR clock ,
and 
the result in
.I buf
is fixed width fields in the format:
.PP
.in +1i
Fri Sep 13 00:00:00 1986\en\e0
.PP
The result buffer
.I buf
must be at least 26 bytes long, and no attempt is made to check this.
.B pmCtime
returns
.I buf
as the value of the function.
.PP
The default current reporting timezone is as defined by the
.B TZ
environment variable, so
.B pmCtime
and
.BR ctime (3)
will initially produce similar encoding of the date and time.
.PP
Use
.BR pmNewZone (3),
.BR pmNewContextZone (3)
or
.BR pmUseZone (3)
to establish a new current reporting timezone that will effect
.B pmCtime
but not
.BR ctime (3).

.BR ctime (3),
.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmLocaltime (3),
.BR pmNewContextZone (3),
.BR pmNewZone (3)
and
.BR pmUseZone (3).
