.TH PMNEWCONTEXTZONE 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmNewContextZone\f1 \- establish a reporting timezone based on a PMAPI context
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
int pmNewContextZone(void);
.sp
cc ... \-lpcp
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CR
.ie t \f(CR\\$1\f1\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
The current reporting timezone affects the timezone used by
.BR pmCtime (3)
and
.BR pmLocaltime (3).
.PP
If the current PMAPI context is an archive,
.B pmNewContextZone
uses the timezone from the archive label record to
set the current reporting timezone.
.PP
If the current PMAPI context
corresponds to a host source of metrics,
.B pmNewContextZone
executes a
.BR pmFetch (3)
to retrieve the value for the metric
.CR pmcd.timezone
and uses that to set the current reporting timezone.
.PP
In both cases,
.B pmNewContextZone
returns a value to identify the current reporting timezone
that may be
used in a subsequent call to
.BR pmUseZone (3)
to restore this reporting timezone.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP
.B PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT
the current PMAPI context is not valid
.TP
other
a return value less than zero indicates a fatal error from a system call,
most likely
.BR malloc (3)
