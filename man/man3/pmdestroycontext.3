.SH DESCRIPTION

..
An application using the
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
may manipulate several concurrent contexts,
each associated with a source of performance metrics, e.g. \c
.BR pmcd (1)
on some host, or an archive log of performance metrics as created by
.BR pmlogger (1).
.PP
.B pmDestroyContext
destroys the PMAPI context identified by
.IR handle .
Typically this would imply some termination of a connection
to a PMCD or closing an archive log file, and orderly clean-up.
.PP
The context
must have been previously created using
.BR pmNewContext (3)
or
.BR pmDupContext (3).
.PP
On success,
.B pmDestroyContext
returns zero.
If
.I handle
was the current
PMAPI context, then the current context becomes undefined.
This means the application must explicitly re-establish a valid
PMAPI context with
.BR pmUseContext (3),
or create a new context with
.BR pmNewContext (3)
or
.BR pmDupContext (3),
before the next PMAPI operation that requires a PMAPI context.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR pmDupContext (3),
.BR pmNewContext (3),
.BR pmUseContext (3)
and
.BR pmWhichContext (3).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.P
.B PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT
.IP
.I handle
does not identify a valid PMAPI context
