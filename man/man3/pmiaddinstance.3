.SH DESCRIPTION
As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
.BR LOGIMPORT (3)),
.B pmiAddInstance
adds a new element to the instance domain identified by
.IR indom .
.PP
.I indom
would normally be constructed using the
.B pmInDom_build
macro, e.g. pmInDom_build(PMI_DOMAIN,0) for the first instance domain
in the Performance Metrics Domain PMI_DOMAIN
(which is the default for all meta data created by the LOGIMPORT library).
.PP
The new instance must have both an external name (\c
.IR instance )
and an internal instance identifier (\c
.IR inst )
that is unique across all instances in the
.I indom
instance domain.
There is a special ``uniqueness rule'' for
.I instance
that is imposed by
.BR pmLookupInDom (3),
namely that the external instance name must be unique in the leading
non-space characters, e.g. the instance names ``foo'' and ``foo bar''
are considered the same by this rule and not allowed in the same
instance domain, but ``foo'' and ``foobar'' would be allowed.
.PP
Once defined, the external instance name can be used in calls to
.BR pmiGetHandle (3)
and/or
.BR pmiPutValue (3)
with the name of a metric defined over the same instance domain.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pmiAddInstance
returns zero on success else a negative value that can be turned into an
error message by calling
.BR pmiErrStr (3).
