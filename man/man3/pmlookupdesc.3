.PP
The
.CW type
field in the 
.CW pmDesc
describes various encodings (or formats) for a metric's value.
.PP
If a value is
counted in the underlying base instrumentation with less than 32 bits of
integer precision, it is the responsibility of the Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) to promote the value to a 32-bit integer before it is
exported into the Performance Metrics Collection Subsystem (PMCS);
i.e. applications above the PMAPI never have to deal with 8-bit and 16-bit
counters.
.PP
If the value of a performance metric is of type
.BR PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE ,
.BR PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE_STATIC,
.B PM_TYPE_EVENT
or
.BR PM_TYPE_STRING ,
the interpretation of the value is unknown to the PMCS.
In these cases, the
application using the value, and the PMDA providing the value must have some
common understanding about how the value is structured and interpreted.
.PP
Each
value for a performance metric is assumed to be drawn from a set of values that
can be described in terms of their dimensionality and scale by a compact
encoding as follows.
The dimensionality is defined by a power, or index, in
each of 3 orthogonal dimensions, namely Space, Time and Count
(or Events, which are dimensionless).
For example I/O throughput might be represented as
.ti 1i
.CW "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0-1"
.ti 1i
.CW "Space.Time"
.br
while the
running total of system calls is
.CW "Count" ,
memory allocation is
.CW Space
and average
service time is
.ti 1i
.CW "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0-1"
.ti 1i
.CW "Time.Count"
.br
In each dimension there are a number
of common scale values that may be used to better encode ranges that might
otherwise exhaust the precision of a 32-bit value.
This information is encoded
in the
.CW pmUnits
structure which is embedded in the
.CW pmDesc
structure.

Special routines (e.g. \c
.BR pmExtractValue (3),
.BR pmConvScale (3))
are provided to manipulate values in
conjunction with the
.CW pmUnits
structure that defines the dimension and scale of the values for a particular
performance metric.
.PP
Below the PMAPI, the information required to complete the 
.CW pmDesc
structure, is fetched from the PMDAs, and in this way the format
and scale of performance metrics may change dynamically, as
the PMDAs and their underlying
instrumentation evolve with time.
In particular, when some metrics suddenly
become 64-bits long, or change their units from Mbytes to Gbytes,
well-written applications
using the services provided by the PMAPI will continue
to function correctly.
