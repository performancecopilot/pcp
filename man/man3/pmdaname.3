.SH DESCRIPTION
As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
.BR PMDA (3)),
.BR pmdaName
is the generic callback for
translating a
.I pmid
into one or more dynamic metric names (\c
.IR nameset ).
.PP
Because implementing dynamic performance metrics requires specific
PMDA support, and the facility is an optional component of a PMDA (most
PMDAs do
.B not
support dynamic performance metrics),
.B pmdaName
is a skeleton implementation that returns
.BR PM_ERR_NAME .
.PP
A PMDA that supports dynamic performance metrics will provide a private
callback that replaces
.B pmdaName
(by assignment to
.I version.four.name
of the
.I pmdaInterface
structure)
and implements the translation from a
.I pmid
to a set of dynamic performance metric names returned via
.IR nameset .
The behaviour, return values and memory allocation rules for
.I nameset
are the same as for
.BR pmNameAll (3).
.SH CAVEAT
The PMDA must be using
.B PMDA_INTERFACE_4
or later, as specified in the call to
.BR pmdaDSO (3)
or
.BR pmdaDaemon (3).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pmdaName
returns
.B PM_ERR_PMID
if the name is not recognized or cannot be translated,
otherwise the number of metric names found (most commonly 1).
