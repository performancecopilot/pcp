.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
The routine
.B pmSortInstances
may be used to guarantee that for each performance metric in the
.I result
from
.BR pmFetch (3)
or
.BR pmFetchHighRes (3),
the instances are in ascending instance identifier sequence.
.PP
This is useful when computing rates from two consecutive samples.
