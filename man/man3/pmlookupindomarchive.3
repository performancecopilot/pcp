.TH PMLOOKUPINDOMARCHIVE 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmLookupInDomArchive\f1 \- translate an instance name into an instance identifier
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CR
.ie t \f(CR\\$1\f1\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Provided the current
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
context is associated with a set of archives,
.B pmLookupInDomArchive
will scan the union of all the instance domain metadata
for the instance domain
.IR indom ,
locate the first instance with the external identification given by
.IR name ,
and return the internal instance identifier.
.PP
This routine is a specialized version of the more general PMAPI
routine
.BR pmLookupInDom .
.PP
Only the leading
non-space characters of
.I name
will be used to identify the instance.
.PP
The value for the instance domain
.I indom
is typically extracted from a
.CR pmDesc
structure, following a call to
.BR pmLookupDesc (3)
for a particular performance metric.
.PP
.B pmLookupInDomArchive
will return a positive instance identifier on success.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOTARCHIVE\f1
the current PMAPI context is not associated with a set of archives
.IP \f3PM_ERR_INDOM_LOG\f1
.I indom
is not a defined instance domain identifier for the set of archives
.IP \f3PM_ERR_INST_LOG\f1
the external instance
.I name
is not known for the instance domain
.I indom
in the set of archives
