.SH DESCRIPTION

.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
In some special cases it may be helpful to modify the current values of
performance metrics,
e.g. to reset a counter to zero, or to modify a ``metric'' which is a control
variable for some agent collecting performance metrics.
.PP
The routines
.B pmStore
and
.B pmStoreHighRes
are lightweight inverses of
.BR pmFetch (3)
and
.BR pmFetchHighRes (3)
respectively.
.PP
The caller must build the
.I result
data structure (of course, this could have been returned from an earlier
.BR pmFetch (3)
or
.BR pmFetchHighRes (3)
call).
.PP
It is an error to pass a
.I result
to
.B pmStore
or
.B pmStoreHighRes
in which the
.CW numval
field within any of the
.B pmValueSet
structures has a value less than one.
.PP
The current
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
context must be one with a host as the source of metrics, and the
current value of the nominated metrics will be changed, i.e.
.B pmStore
and
.B pmStoreHighRes
cannot be used to make retrospective changes to information in either
the archives, or in the recent past for real-time sources of metrics.
.PP
The return code from
.B pmStore
and
.B pmStoreHighRes
is zero for success.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_GENERIC\f1
At least one of the modifications was rejected.
No other status is available from below the PMAPI (this is the
lightweight part of the functionality!).
In cases where the outcome of storing into individual metrics is
important, the caller should make one call to either
.B pmStore
or
.B pmStoreHighRes
for each metric.
On the other hand, a bulk modification can be performed in a
single call for situations in which the outcome is not critical.
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOTHOST\f1
The current PMAPI context is an archive rather than a host, or it
is a host that is not set to the current time, i.e. has been ``rewound''
to the recent past using
.BR pmSetMode (3)
or
.BR pmSetModeHighRes (3).
.IP \f3PM_ERR_TOOSMALL\f1
The number of metrics specified in
.I result
is less than one.
.IP \f3PM_ERR_VALUE\f1
One or more of the
.CW pmValueSet s
in
.I result
has a
.CW numval
field with a value less than one.
