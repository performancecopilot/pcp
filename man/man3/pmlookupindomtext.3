.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CR
.ie t \f(CR\\$1\f1\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Retrieve descriptive text about the performance
metrics instance domain identified by
.IR indom .
.PP
The value for the instance domain
.I indom
is typically extracted from a
.CR pmDesc
structure, following a call to
.BR pmLookupDesc (3)
for a particular performance metric.
.PP
The argument
.I level
should be
.BR PM_TEXT_ONELINE
for a one-line summary, else
.BR PM_TEXT_HELP
for a more verbose description, suited to a help dialog.
.PP
The space pointed to by
.I buffer
will have been allocated in
.B pmLookupInDomText
with
.BR malloc (3),
and it is the responsibility of the caller to
.BR free (3)
the space when it is no longer required.
.PP
.B pmLookupInDomText
returns zero on success.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOTHOST\f1
For archives created with versions of PCP prior to 4.0, if the
current PMAPI context is an archive (help and one-line text
was previously not maintained in the archives)
