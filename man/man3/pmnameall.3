.TH PMNAMEALL 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmNameAll\f1 \- translate a PMID to a set of performance metric names

.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CR
.ie t \f(CR\\$1\f1\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Given a
Performance Metric Identifier (PMID) via
.IR pmid ,
.B pmNameAll
will
determine all the corresponding metric names, if any, in the
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), and return these via
.IR nameset .
.PP
The resulting list of pointers
.I nameset
.B and
the values
(the relative names) that the pointers reference will have been
allocated by
.B pmNameAll
with a single call to
.BR malloc (3),
and it is the
responsibility of the
.B pmNameAll
caller to use
.CR free(nameset)
to release the space when it is no longer required.
.PP
In the absence of errors,
.B pmNameAll
returns the number of names in
.IR nameset .
.PP
For many examples of a PMNS, there will be a 1:1 mapping between
a name and a PMID, and under these circumstances,
.BR pmNameID (3)
provides a slightly simpler interface in the absence of duplicate
names for a particular PMID.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOPMNS\f1
Failed to access a PMNS for operation.
Note that if the application hasn't a priori called
.BR pmLoadNameSpace (3)
and wants to use the distributed PMNS, then a call to
.B pmNameAll
must be made after the creation of a context (see
.BR pmNewContext (3)).
.IP \f3PM_ERR_PMID\f1
.I pmid
does not correspond to a defined PMID in the PMNS.
.IP \f3PM_ERR_*\f1
Other diagnostics are for protocol failures when
accessing the distributed PMNS.
