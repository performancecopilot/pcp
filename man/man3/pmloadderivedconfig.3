.TH PMLOADDERIVEDCONFIG 3 "" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmLoadDerivedConfig\f1 \- load derived metric definitions from files
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
int pmLoadDerivedConfig(char *\fIpath\fP);
.sp
cc ... \-lpcp
.ft 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Derived metrics may be used to extend the available metrics with
new (derived) metrics using simple arithmetic expressions.
The definitions of these metrics can be persisted and loaded
programatically by monitor tools using
.BR pmLoadDerivedConfig .
.PP
The
.I path
parameter defines a colon separated list of files and/or
directories (the syntax is the same as for the
.B $PATH
variable for
.BR sh (1)),
from which derived metric specifications are to be sourced.
The
.I path
components are expanded into a list of files as follows: if a component
is a file, then that file is added to the list, else if a component
is a directory then recursive descent is used to enumerate all
files below that directory and these are added to the list.
Each file in the resulting list is parsed in order, and according to
the derived metrics syntax described below.
.PP
Each line of the file(s) identified by
.I path
is either a comment line (with a ``#'' in the first position of the line)
or the declaration of a derived performance metric, specified as:
.IP * 2n
the name of the derived metric, using the same ``dot notation'' syntax
that is used for PCP performance metrics, see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
and
.BR pmns (5).
.IP * 2n
an equals sign (``='')
.IP * 2n
a valid expression for a derived metric, as described in
.BR pmRegisterDerived (3).
.PP
White space is ignored in the lines.
.PP
For each line containing a derived metric definition,
.BR pmRegisterDerived (3)
is called to register the new derived metric.
.PP
The result from
.B pmLoadDerivedConfig
will be the number of derived metrics loaded from files on the given
.IR path ,
else a value less than zero in the case of an error.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
# sample derived metric definitions
bad_in_pkts = network.interface.in.errors + network.interface.in.drops
# note the following would need to be on a single line ...
disk.dev.read_pct = 100 * delta(disk.dev.read) /
            (delta(disk.dev.read) + delta(disk.dev.write))
.fi
