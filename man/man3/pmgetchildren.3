.TH PMGETCHILDREN 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmGetChildren\f1 \- return the descendent nodes of a PMNS node
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"

#include <pcp/pmapi.h>

int pmGetChildren(const char *\fIname\fP, char ***\fIoffspring\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CW
.ie t \f(CW\\$1\f1\\$2
.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Given a fully qualified pathname to a node in the current Performance
Metrics Name Space (PMNS), as identified by
.IR name ,
.B pmGetChildren
returns via
.I offspring
a list of the relative names of
all of the immediate descendent nodes of
.I name
in the current PMNS.
.PP
As a
special case, if
.I name
is an empty string (i.e.\f3""\f1), the immediate descendants of
the root node in the PMNS will be returned.
.PP 
Normally,
.B pmGetChildren
will return the number of descendent names discovered, else a value
less than zero for an error.
The value zero indicates that
.I name
is a valid metric name, i.e. is associated with a leaf node in the PMNS.
.PP
The resulting list of pointers
.I offspring
.B and
the values
(the relative names) that the pointers reference will have been
allocated by
.B pmGetChildren
with a single call to
.BR malloc (3C),
and it is the
responsibility of the
.B pmGetChildren
caller to
.BR free (\c
.IR offspring )
to release the space
when it is no longer required.
.PP
When an error occurs, or
.I name 
is a leaf node (i.e. the result of
.B pmGetChildren
is less than one),
.I offspring
is undefined (no space will have been
allocated, and so calling
.BR free (3C)
is a singularly bad idea).
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
Values for these variables may be obtained programmatically
using the
.BR pmGetConfig (3)
function.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOPMNS\f1
Failed to access a PMNS for operation.
Note that if the application hasn't a priori called pmLoadNameSpace(3)
and wants to use the distributed PMNS, then a call to
.B pmGetChildren
must be made inside a current context.
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NAME\f1
The pathname
.I name
is not valid in the current PMNS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_*\f1
Other diagnostics are for protocol failures when
accessing the distributed PMNS.
