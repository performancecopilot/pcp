.SH DESCRIPTION
As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
.BR PMDA (3)),
.BR pmdaStore
is the generic callback for storing a value into a metric.
.B pmdaStore
is usually a no-op as, by default, no metrics can be altered.
Also, the implementation of a store callback which does permit
metrics to be altered by
.BR pmstore (1)
is very application dependent.
.SH CAVEAT
The PMDA must be using
.B PMDA_INTERFACE_2
or later, as specified in the call to
.BR pmdaDSO (3)
or
.BR pmdaDaemon (3).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B
pmdaStore
returns
.B PM_ERR_PERMISSION
to indicate that no metrics may be modified.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR pmstore (1),
.BR PMAPI (3),
.BR PMDA (3),
.BR pmdaDaemon (3),
.BR pmdaDSO (3)
and
.BR pmStore (3).
