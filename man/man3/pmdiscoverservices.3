.SH DESCRIPTION

.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Given a PCP service name, as identified by
.IR service ,
and using the type of discovery optionally specified in
.IR mechanism ,
.B pmDiscoverServices
returns, via
.IR urls ,
a list of URLs representing the services discovered on the network.
.PP 
.I service
specifies the PCP service to be discovered. Currently supported services are
.B PM_SERVER_SERVICE_SPEC,
.B PM_PROXY_SERVICE_SPEC
and
.B PM_WEBD_SERVICE_SPEC,
which search for
.BR pmcd (1),
.BR pmproxy (1),
and
.BR pmwebd (1),
servers respectively.
.PP 
.IR mechanism
specifies the style of discovery to be used.
.PP
The currently supported mechanisms are:
.TP
.B avahi
This searches for services which are broadcasting using mDNS via
.BR avahi-daemon (8).
An optional suffix \fB",timeout=NNNN"\fP may be added
to specify the discovery timeout, in floating-point multiples of one
second.  The default timeout is 0.5 seconds, which may be overridden
by the \fBAVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT\fP environment variable, also
specified in floating-point multiples of one second.
.TP
.B probe=<net-address>/<mask-bits>
Actively probes the given subnet for the requested PCP service(s).
<net-address> is an inet or ipv6
network address and <mask-bits> is the number of bits used to define the
subnet. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an 8 bit subnet consisting of the
addresses 192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255.
An optional suffix \fB",maxThreads=N"\fP may be added to limit the number of
threads used while probing. The default is no fixed limit, which is to say that
the process' rlimits for the number of threads and open file descriptors
will be respected.
.PP
.IR mechanism
may also be NULL, which means to use all available discovery mechanisms.
.PP 
Normally,
.B pmDiscoverServices
will return the number of services discovered, else a value
less than zero for an error.
The value zero indicates that no services were discovered.
.PP
The resulting list of pointers,
.IR urls ,
.B and
the values
(the URLs) that the pointers reference will have been
allocated by
.B pmDiscoverServices
with a single call to
.BR malloc (3C),
and it is the
responsibility of the
.B pmDiscoverServices
caller to
.BR free (\c
.IR urls )
to release the space
when it is no longer required.
.PP
When an error occurs, or no services are discovered,
.I urls
is undefined (no space will have been
allocated, and so calling
.BR free (3C)
is a singularly bad idea).
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
Values for these variables may be obtained programmatically
using the
.BR pmGetConfig (3)
function.
