.SH DESCRIPTION

.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
Within the framework of the
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), archive logs of performance metrics values
may be accumulated and saved using the program
.BR pmlogger (1).
.PP
The routine
.B pmGetArchiveLabel
may be used to fetch the label record from an archive log that has already
been opened using
.BR pmNewContext (3),
or
.BR pmDupContext (3),
and thereby associated with the current
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
context.
.PP
The result returned via the pointer
.I lp
is a structure that must be pre-allocated by the caller
and has the following format (defined in
.BR pmapi.h ).
.PP

/*
 * Label Record at the start of every log file
 */
typedef struct {
  int        ll_magic;    /* PM_LOG_MAGIC | log format version no. */
  pid_t      ll_pid;      /* PID of logger */
  struct timeval ll_start;/* start of this log */
  char       ll_hostname[PM_LOG_MAXHOSTLEN]; /* name of collection host */
  char       ll_tz[40];   /* $TZ at collection host */
} pmLogLabel;

.PP
For an application, the most useful information from the archive label
is likely to be in the fields
.CW ll_start ,
.CW ll_hostname
or
.CW ll_tz .
.PP
Note that the size of the
.CW ll_hostname
field is
.CW PM_LOG_MAXHOSTLEN
(64 bytes)
which is less than
.BR MAXHOSTNAMELEN
(see
.BR gethostbyname (3))
on some platforms.
These semantics are necessary to retain backwards compatibility with the
PCP archive file format.
.PP
.B pmGetArchiveLabel
returns zero for success.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
Values for these variables may be obtained programmatically
using the
.BR pmGetConfig (3)
function.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT\f1
the current PMAPI context
is either invalid, or not associated with an archive log
