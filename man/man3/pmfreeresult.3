.SH DESCRIPTION
.de CR

.el \fI\\$1\f1\\$2
..
The variable sized results returned by
.BR pmFetch (3)
and
.BR pmFetchHighRes (3)
are allocated below the
Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
using a combination of dynamic (i.e. \c
.BR malloc (3))
and specialized allocation strategies.
.PP
Applications should call
.B pmFreeResult
to release the storage previously allocated for
.I result
by
.BR pmFetch (3),
when the application no longer requires access to the
.CR pmResult
structure.
.PP
Under
.B no
circumstances should an application use
.CR "free(result)"
to release storage previously allocated for a
.CR pmResult
by
.BR pmFetch (3).
.PP
Similarly, memory allocated for the high resolution timestamped
.I result
structure returned from
.BR pmFetchHighRes (3)
should be released by a call to
.BR pmFreeHighResResult .
