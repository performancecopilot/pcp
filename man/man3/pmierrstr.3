.SH DESCRIPTION
As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
.BR LOGIMPORT (3)),
.B pmiErrStr
translates error codes returned from the other routines
in the Log Import library into printable error messages.
.PP
.I code
would normally have a negative value.
As a special case, if
.I code
is \-1 then the error code returned from the last routine
called in the LOGIMPORT library for this context will be
used.
.PP
The
.B pmiErrStr_r
function does the same, but stores the result in a user-supplied buffer
.I buf
of length
.IR buflen ,
which should have room for at least
.B PMI_MAXERRMSGLEN
bytes.
.PP
The set of possible error codes and messages is all those defined
by
.BR pmErrStr (3)
and
.BR PCPIntro (3),
plus the additional ones defined in
.B <pcp/import.h>
with error code names of the form
.BR PMI_ERR_....
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR LOGIMPORT (3),
.BR PCPIntro (3)
and
.BR pmErrStr (3).
