.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3mmv_set\f1,
\f3mmv_set_value\f1
and
\f3mmv_set_atomvalue\f1
provide convenient ways of directly setting a value for a
metric \f2av\f1 previously returned by the
.BR mmv_lookup_value_desc (3)
interface.
\f2addr\f1 is the address returned from
.BR mmv_stats_init (3).
.P
These interfaces are typically used with instantaneous and
discrete metrics.
Refer to
.BR mmv_inc_value (3)
for a mechanism suited to monotonic increasing counter metrics.
.P
With \f3mmv_set\f1 and
\f3mmv_set_atomvalue\f1 the value provided via the \f2val\f1
pointer must match the type of the metric and will be used as
the new value of the metric.
.P
In the case of \f3mmv_set\f1 and \f3mmv_set_value\f1, the
pointer value \f2val\f1 is internally cast to match the type of
the metric and then used as the value for the metric.
