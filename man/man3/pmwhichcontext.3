Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
may manipulate several concurrent contexts,
each associated with a source of performance metrics, e.g. \c
.BR pmcd (1)

returns a handle for the current PMAPI context, that may
be used in the associated PMAPI routines that require a handle
to identify a PMAPI context.
