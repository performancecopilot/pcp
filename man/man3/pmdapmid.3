.SH DESCRIPTION
As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
.BR PMDA (3)),
.BR pmdaPMID
is the generic callback for translating a dynamic metric
.I name
into a PMID (\c
.IR pmid ).
.PP
Because implementing dynamic performance metrics requires specific
PMDA support, and the facility is an optional component of a PMDA (most
PMDAs do
.B not
support dynamic performance metrics),
.B pmdaPMID
is a skeleton implementation that returns
.BR PM_ERR_NAME .
.PP
A PMDA that supports dynamic performance metrics will provide a private
callback that replaces
.B pmdaPMID
(by assignment to
.I version.four.pmid
of the
.I pmdaInterface
structure)
and implements the translation from a dynamic performance metric
.I name
into the associated
.IR pmid .
.SH CAVEAT
The PMDA must be using
.B PMDA_INTERFACE_4
or later, as specified in the call to
.BR pmdaDSO (3)
or
.BR pmdaDaemon (3).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pmdaPMID
returns
.B PM_ERR_NAME
if the name is not recognized or cannot be translated, else returns 0.
