.TH PMNAMEID 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmNameID\f1 \- translate a PMID to a performance metric name
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Given a
Performance Metric Identifier (PMID) via
.IR pmid ,
.B pmNameID
will
determine the corresponding metric name, if any, in the
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), and return this via
.IR name .
.PP
If the PMNS contains multiple names associated with the requested
PMID, one of these will be returned via
.IR name ,
but there is no way to determine which of the duplicate names
this will be.  See
.BR pmNameAll (3)
if all of the corresponding names are required.
.PP
As of Version 3.10.3 of PCP, duplicate names for the same PMID
.B are
allowed in the PMNS, so using
.BR pmNameAll (3)
is recommended over
.BR pmNameID .
.PP
.I name
is a null-byte terminated string, allocated by
.B pmNameID
using
.BR malloc (3)
and it is the caller's responsibility to call
.BR free (3)
to release the storage when the value is no longer required.
.PP
In the absence of errors,
.B pmNameID
returns zero.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP \f3PM_ERR_NOPMNS\f1
Failed to access a PMNS for operation.
Note that if the application hasn't a priori called
.BR pmLoadNameSpace (3)
and wants to use the distributed PMNS, then a call to
.B pmNameID
must be made after the creation of a context (see
.BR pmNewContext (3)).
.IP \f3PM_ERR_PMID\f1
.I pmid
does not correspond to a defined PMID in the PMNS.
.IP \f3PM_ERR_*\f1
Other diagnostics are for protocol failures when
accessing the distributed PMNS.
