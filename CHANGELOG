pcp-6.0.0 (31 August 2022)
    - Major changes:
	1. Add version 3 PCP archive support: instance domain change-deltas,
	   Y2038-safe timestamps, nanosecond-precision timestamps, arbitrary
	   timezones support, 64-bit file offsets used throughout for larger
	   (beyond 2GB) individual volumes.
	   ** Opt-in using the /etc/pcp.conf PCP_ARCHIVE_VERSION setting. **
	   ** Version 2 archives remain the default (for next few years). **
	2. Switch to using OpenSSL only throughout PCP (dropped NSS/NSPR);
	   this impacts on libpcp, PMAPI clients and PMCD use of encryption;
	   these are now configured and used consistently with pmproxy HTTPS
	   support and redis-server, which were both already using OpenSSL.
	3. New nanosecond precision timestamp PMAPI calls for PCP library
	   interfaces that make use of timestamps.  These are all optional,
	   and full backward compatibility is preserved for existing tools.

      this class of socket is used.  In a future release, it hoped
      to make this the default local connection style.
    - Extensions to pmdaproc to allow it to perform access-control
      checking and metric value fetches as the user requesting the
      data, instead of as root, such that kernel-based permission

      and not other client nodes.  Thanks to Nigel Donaldson.
    - Added interfaces to PCP::PMDA Perl module to allow PMDAs to
      use a hash instance domain (instead of int/string array).

      keys are the (external) PCP instance names, and the value
      associated with each key is an opaque reference.

    - Infrastucture support for doing distributed event tracing with PCP.
      This includes a new metric type (PM_TYPE_EVENT), cunning mechanisms
      for encoding event records in pmResults, and providing PMDAs with
      per-client context connection information allowing agents to track

      pcp-libs is common - it's required by pcp and by pcp-libs-devel but
      pcp and pcp-libs-devel can be installed with or without each other.
    - Added separate specific licenses for the new subpackages,
      particularly pcp-libs, which is LGPL.

    - Default "chkconfig off" for all PCP services (retain settings on upgrade)
    - Clean-up and simplify the %post scriptlets (rather dramatically)
    - Don't ship static libraries in Fedora, we have the debug package for that
    - Install .NeedRebuild, add to %files and remove crud from %post scriptlets
    - Added %changelog in RPM spec and moved %files to end before %changelog
    - Move demos, examples and demo PMDAS to the libs-devel package since they

    - fixed bug #827972, pcp root exploit with pmpost
    - fixed assorted other security issues.

pcp-2.2.0-15 (23 May 2001)
    - don't include linux/kernel_stat.h and avoid __sparc__ conditional code 
    - from Michal Kara: rc will rebuild PMNS if root_* files newer than root
    - add the roomtemp PMDA for measuring temperatures using the 1-Wire
      serial network ans sensor technology from Dallas Semiconductor
    - zero network.tcpconn values before counting them in /proc/net/tcp
      (Michal Kara's original code was correct - markgw busted it!)
    - add new LGPL library libpcp_http. Used by permission of the author,
      Laurent Demailly <L@Demailly.com>
    - minor surgery on apache PMDA to link with -lpcp_http
    - minor fix diagnostic from __pmLogRead
    - as reported by Alexander L. Belikoff <abel@vallinor4.com>, it was
      not possible to disable the primary logger via changes to the
      /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/control file ... this has been fixed
    - as reported by Alan Bailey <bailey@mcs.anl.gov>, the assumption
      that /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/control was version 1.1 was implicit 
      ... this is now documented and the pmlogger_* scripts will warn
      if the deprecated version 1.0 format is used accidently
    - from Michal Kara: fix mem leak in apache PMDA
    - from Michal Kara: install /var/pcp/config/pmlogger/Makefile
      (src is in src/pmlogctl/Makefile.install). This provides pre-processing
      of pmlogger config files with cpp.
    - reintroduction of "impl.h" header, deprecate "pmapi_dev.h" and major
      makefile surgery to reintegrate the IRIX and Linux PCP source trees
    - add ia64 support infrastructure.
    - use -fno-strict-aliasing for correct ia64 compilation
    - use -fpic to avoid gprel errors linking shlibs on ia64
    - don't use -P with cpp, thus preserve line numbers

    - surgery on almost all man pages, merge with IRIX PCP man pages
    - promote shping to open-source status
    - fix bug #814989 where disk.all.* not summed correctly (if the sard
      patch has been applied to running kernel)
    - with the sard patch applied to the kernel, disk.all metrics were
      being summed as the total of disk.partitions and disk.dev metrics,
      resulting in approximately twice the rate of disk I/O for the
      disk.all metrics
    - added more disk metrics and update help text
    - the "cpu" instance domain is now dynamic and supports any number of CPUs
    - fixed pmie rc and pmie_{check,daily} scripts
    - a bunch of places were using $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmcd/pmcd.conf
      as the path to pmcd.conf (which is correct). Others were using
      /etc/pmcd.conf (which is only correct on IRIX).
    - merged IRIX/Linux versions of pmsocks
    - mimic the IRIX xconfirm behaviour more closely, pv 817289
    - pv:817367 Handle SIGCHLD from xconfirm problem on Linux
    - minor changes in error messages to make them less IRIX-centric
      and hence more sensible for Linux

      detected as CERN not NS_PROXY.
    - fix weblog so regex in the configuration file is recognized
      correctly on all platforms
    - only run weblogconv.sh on linux
    - conversion to more simple copyright in numerous places
    - avoid grep -q usage: not supported on early IRIX
    - pv:803341 Change Creator: for mkaf from mkaf to pmchart to assist
      with pmafm replay when pcp also installed.
    - updated man page text for platform-agnostic descriptions.
    - fix 817880 pmafm remove does not list all files
    - src/pmie/GNUmakefile Fix busted sed translation of the control
      file so the logfiles (and hence directories) are ...pmie/<hostname>
      rather than pmie<hostname>
    - renamed all Makefiles to GNUmakefile
    - makefile surgery to allow multiple RPMs to be built from one src tree
    - fixes to src/pmcd/pmdaproc.sh to not use test -e
    - pv:815326 fix pcp linux /usr/share/magic doesn't detect pmie config
    - pv:818381 fix pmie_check fails esp integration
    - man page for pmlogsummary was in both pcp and pcp-pro
    - fix to src/pmie/pmie_check.sh, improve pattern to match No such
      file or directory for linux
    - fix all linux specs to install root,root rather than root,bin
      (needed to avoid warnings when installing on redhat7.1)
    - add GNUmakefile.install for all PMDAs, installed in each PMDA dir
    - fix src/pmdas/weblog/server.sh to use quotes on -d that was breaking
      when parameter empty.
    - pv:807561 change pmprobe -i and -I semantics to call pmGetInDom
      rather than using the returned indom from pmFetch
    - add hinv.machine for oview to use
    - change the cpu instance domain to use the numa names if they are
      present on the machine, else revert to cpuX syntax
    - numerous fixes so the src RPM builds on all platforms
    - pv:824382 - xfs block metrics were scaled incorrectly
    - add support for /proc/slabinfo metrics (mem.slabinfo.*)
    - add new "process" and "mounts" PMDAs, contributed by Alan Baily
    - added GPL copyrights to process and mounts src, fixed makefiles
      to extract domain number from stdpmid and added install targets,
      and small change to ignore comments in conf files.
    - added hinv.pagesize (uses the getpagesize(2) system call)
    - fixed bug #825229 where rpm upgrade would clobber root pmns for PMDAs

pcp-2.1.10-8 (released circa Oct 18 2000, with SGI ACE1.4)
    - guard against DOS attack by restring incoming PDU size to 64K.
    - add hinv.map.cpu and hinv.cpu metrics exported by /proc/cpuinfo

      entries in the .SH NAME section.
    - add network.tcpconn metrics to export counts of tcp connections in each
      state. Code contributed by Michal Kara (lemming@arthur.plbohnice.cz)
    - few minor fixes for build on ia64

pcp-2.1.9-12 (released circa Sept 13 2000, with SGI Propack1.4)
    - for 2.4 without sard, correctly match disk numbers in /proc/stat
      with major,minor numbers in /proc/partitions.

pcp-2.1.9-11 (unreleased)
    - add pagebuf metrics (Daniel and Nathan)
    - fixes so the build works if pcp is not already installed
    - minor security fix to pcp.spec.in (force mode 644 for .NeedRebuild)
    - make sure the src RPM builds correctly (LSRCFILE issues from LinuxWorld)
    - fix for bug #797756, upgrade from pcp2.1.6 to any newer version leaves
      pcp chkconfig off and the name space does not get rebuilt.
    - extended the weblogs PCP agent so it can report proxy/squid
      http servers, and added assorted http cache statistics.
    - fixed the Cisco router PCP agent (it was broken in pp1.3).
    - add support for disk stats in 2.4.x kernels with "disk_io" field
      in /proc/stat (only used when sard patch is not installed)
    - if the pcp-pro package (SGI proprietary) is installed, all libpcp
      clients on linux are now "authorized" to monitor IRIX systems that
      do not have a pmcd collector license.

pcp-2.1.9-6 (released 2 Aug 2000 for propack1.4 - alpha, not final)
    - install /usr/share/pcp/lib/rc-proc.sh containing common
      shell functions for use by rc scripts - these functions
      are tolerant of the chkconfig command missing (as in SUSE).
    - update all rc scripts and {pmlogger,pmie}_{check,daily} scripts
      to use the new rc-proc.sh functions. Remove the /etc/sysconfig
      stuff entirely (it was not being used anyway).
    - fix for #795934 : after rpm -U, pcp is chkconfig off. It turned
      out that an upgrade executes the %post _and_ the %preun scripts,
      which resulted in pcp being chkconfig'd on then off again.
    - fix pmie rc scripts so they work, are chkconfig friendly,
      and cope with _and_ without pmieconf (which is in pcp-pro).
      Also install /var/pcp/config/pmie/config.default as a simple example
      to monitor the load average and report to syslog. The pmie
      daemon is chkconfig off by default.
    - default run levels for pmcd and pmie (daemon) are now 2345, for SUSE
    - reconcile troff and groff differences in man page sources
    - fix for bug #797049 use strftime(%z) to determine timezone offsets
      w.r.t. daylight savings
    - portability surgery on src/libpcp_trace, and add new pmtracecounter()
      function, see pmtracebegin(3) for details.
    - reconcile pcp.env and pmcd.options from IRIX
    - fix for bug #797048 update-magic does not fully remove old entries
      before adding new, hence the magic file would grow after each upgrade
    - other minor reconciliation work with IRIX
    - fix build environment to allow proper handling of compressed man pages
    - add support for RPM version 4.
    - add support for add kernel.{all,percpu}.syscall metrics
      (requires kernel patch)
    - fixed for bug #797164: potential SEGV due to calling realloc on a 
      misused pointer - src/pmdas/weblog/weblog.c
    - use realpath(3) to resolve devices in /proc/mounts for filesys.* metrics


pcp-2.1.8-2 (released 30 June 2000)
    - fix for bug #793871 pmlogger_check fails after redhat upgrade
      (because PCP entries in /usr/share/magic were clobbered)
    - also install /var/pcp/pmdas/linux/pmdalinux (as a non-DSO
      agent for debugging and profiling purposes).
    - added pmda.uname (uname -a) and pmda.version (linux pmda version)
      metrics. The pmda.uname metric is needed by the "pcp" command.
    - fix for #789025 fix to ensure rpm --verify succeeds immediately
      after an install, and other errors in pmlogger_check
    - released with ACE 1.3 (MR 19 Jul 2000)

pcp-2.1.7 (internal release for testing)
    - merged changes from IRIX for multiple namespace support in
      pmdaproc.sh
    - parameterized path to pmcd.conf and pmcd.options to avoid
      having to move these files in IRIX. Use PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH and
      PCP_PMCDOPTIONS_PATH respectfully.
    - add new error define PM_ERR_LOGFILE (reconciled from IRIX)
    - conditional pragma for pmGetConfig (not used in linux)
    - use if defined(HAVE_OBJECT_STYLE) to guard __pmCheckObjectStyle
      since it's not used in linux (reconciled with irix code)
    - correct logic used to scan for pmlogger pid in pmlogger_check
      in case where pmlogger exits prematurely, part of #789025
    - added -Wall to default CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
    - added xfs metrics (needs kernel support else no values available)
      extracted from /proc/fs/xfs/stat
    - added nfs (version 3) metrics, same names as on irix, bug #789669
    - fix instance domain for kernel.percpu.interrupts, bug #790372

pcp-2.1.6 (released 3 May 2000)
    - released with ISE 1.2 (MR 25 May 2000)
    - released with ISEMAIL 1.0 (MR 24 May 2000)
    - this is the version shipped with SGI ProPack1.3
    - change use of __clone to pthread_create for portability
    - add support for raid disk stats (previously ignored)
    - fix for bug #789425 pmie suspect behaviour with "delta" keyword
    - add support for devfs style scsi disk names
    - fixed a problem where nfs stats were always showing NFSv3 stats
      rather than NFSv2 stats. We are not (yet) supporting NFSv3 stats.

pcp-2.1.5 (released 12 April 2000)
    - released with SGI ACE 1.2 (MR 19 Apr 200)
    - fix bug #786743 filesys metrics are wrong
    - fix potential segfault bug in timezone handling
    - tolerate SUSE's location of magic file different to Redhat's
    - tolerate no chkconfig on SUSE (use %postinstall create rc symlinks)

pcp-2.1.4 (released 15 Feb 2000)
    - fix for segfault src/pmdas/linux/pmda.c on linuxppc, found by
      Dale F. Brantly <dale.brantly@sgi.com>
    - fix build error in src/pmclient, was trying to use pmgenmap
      without /etc/pcp.env, also found by Dale.
    - setlinebuf(stdout) for all clients that loop
      (fixes a buffering problem on alpha-linux).
    - fixed some missing "{" in conditional variable assignments
      in src/pmie/etc_init.d_pmie (found by lstep@free.fr)
    - changed use of pmgenmap in build for pmclient and
      pmkstat to be consistent (found by lstep@free.fr)
    - don't assume clock tick rate is 100/second. Use the CLK_TCK macro
      instead. Rearrange arithmetic in src/pmdas/linux/pmda.c where we
      divide by CLK_TCK to avoid truncation in conversions from jiffies
      to milliseconds.
    - return "no values available" rather than PM_ERR_APPVERSION for
      the metrics disk.{all,dev}.{read,write,total}_bytes since these
      are not available on systems without the "sard disk patch".  This
      is now consistent with requests for disk.partitions.* metrics.

pcp-2.1.3 (released with 2.1.4)
    - released with ISE 1.0 (MR 1 Mar 2000)
    - added hinv.map.scsi metric as a map of SCSI devices (if any)
    - added disk.dev.{read,write,total}_bytes
    - filter devpts from filesys.* metrics to avoid FPE errors
    - added support for new style Apache configuration file and
      "silent" install to weblog scripts

    - released with SGI ACE 1.0
    - fixed date field in LSM
    - install pmiestats.h for pmieconf
    - renamed /var/pcp/config/pmafm/pcp-col to
      /var/pcp/config/pmafm/pcp
    - added network.{ip,icmp,tcp,udp} metrics
      extracted from /proc/net/snmp
    - fixed shell syntax error in pmlogger_daily(1)
      (changed test -l to test -f)
    - fixed problem with definition of __psint_t on 64bit machines
