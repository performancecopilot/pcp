<title>Related Resources</title>
<para>The <citetitle>Performance Co-Pilot Programmer's Guide</citetitle>,
a companion document to the
<citetitle>Performance Co-Pilot User's and Administrator's Guide</citetitle>,
is intended for developers who want to use the PCP framework and services for
exporting additional collections of performance metrics, or for delivering
new or customized applications to enhance performance management.
</para>
<para>The <citetitle>Performance Co-Pilot Tutorials and Case Studies</citetitle> 
provides a series of real-world examples of using various PCP tools, and
lessons learned from deploying the toolkit in production environments.
It serves to provide reinforcement of the general concepts discussed in the
other two books with additional case studies, and in some cases very detailed
discussion of specifics of individual tools.
</para>
<para>Additional resources include man pages and the project web site.</para>
</section>
<section id="id5178967">

<title>Man Pages</title>
<para>The operating system man pages provide concise reference information on the use of commands, subroutines, and system resources. There is usually a man page for each PCP command or subroutine. To see a list of all the PCP man pages, start from the following command:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>man PCPIntro</userinput></literallayout>
<para>Each man page usually has a &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; section, linking to other, related entries.</para>
<para>To see a particular man page, supply its name to the <literal>man</literal> command, for example:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>man pcp</userinput></literallayout>
<para>The man pages are arranged in different sections - user commands, programming interfaces, and so on.
For a complete list of manual sections on a platform enter the command:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>man man</userinput></literallayout>
<para>When referring to man pages, this guide follows a standard convention: the section number in parentheses follows the item.
For example, <command>pminfo(1)</command> refers to the man page in section 1 for the <command>pminfo</command> command.</para>

<para>Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) provides a range of services that may
be used to monitor and manage system performance. These services are distributed
and scalable to accommodate the most complex system configurations and
performance problems.</para>
<section id="LE67354-PARENT">

<title>PCP Target Usage</title>
<para><indexterm id="IG313718883"><primary>target usage</primary></indexterm>PCP is targeted
at the performance analyst, benchmarker, capacity planner, developer,
database administrator, or system administrator with an interest in overall
system performance and a need to quickly isolate and understand performance
behavior, resource utilization, activity levels, and bottlenecks in complex
systems. Platforms that can benefit from this level of performance analysis
include large servers, server clusters, or multiserver sites delivering
Database Management Systems (DBMS), compute, Web, file, or video services.

<section id="LE79006-PARENT">

<title>Empowering the PCP User</title>
<para><indexterm id="IG313718884"><primary>audience</primary></indexterm>To deal efficiently
with the dynamic behavior of complex systems, performance analysts need
to filter out noise from the overwhelming stream of performance data,
and focus on exceptional scenarios. Visualization of current and historical
performance data, and automated reasoning about performance data, effectively
provide this filtering.</para>
<para>From the PCP end user's perspective, PCP presents an integrated
suite of tools, user interfaces, and services that support real-time and
retrospective performance analysis, with a bias towards eliminating mundane
information and focusing attention on the exceptional and extraordinary
performance behaviors. When this is done, the user can concentrate on
in-depth analysis or target management procedures for those critical system
performance problems.</para>

metric domains</primary></indexterm>At the lowest level, performance metrics
are collected and managed in autonomous performance domains such as the
operating system kernel, a DBMS, a layered service, or an end-user application.
These domains feature a multitude of access control policies, access methods,
data semantics, and multiversion support. All this detail is irrelevant
to the developer or user of a performance monitoring tool, and is hidden
by the PCP infrastructure.</para>

of performance management tools mandate a single scheme for naming performance
metrics. The set of defined names constitutes a Performance Metrics Name
Space (PMNS). Within PCP, the PMNS is adaptive so it can be extended,
reshaped, and pruned to meet the needs of particular applications and
users.</para>
<para>PCP provides a single interface to name and retrieve values for
all performance metrics, independently of their source or location.</para>

<title>PCP Distributed Operation</title>
<para><indexterm id="ITch01-2"><primary>PCP</primary><secondary>distributed

single workstation must be able to monitor the concurrent performance
of multiple remote hosts. At the same time, a single host may be subject
to monitoring from multiple remote workstations.</para>
<para><indexterm id="IG3137188813"><primary>client-server architecture</primary></indexterm>These
requirements suggest a classic client-server architecture, which is exactly
what PCP uses to provide concurrent and multiconnected access to performance

<title>Dynamic Adaptation to Change</title>
<para><indexterm id="IG3137188814"><primary>dynamic adaptation</primary></indexterm><indexterm id="IG3137188815">
<primary>adaptation</primary></indexterm>Complex systems are subject to
continual changes as network connections fail and are reestablished; nodes
are taken out of service and rebooted; hardware is added and removed;
and software is upgraded, installed, or removed. Often these changes are
asynchronous and remote (perhaps in another geographic region or domain
of administrative control).</para>
<para>The distributed nature of the PCP (and the modular fashion in which
performance metrics domains can be installed, upgraded, and configured
on different hosts) enables PCP to adapt concurrently to changes in the
monitored system(s). Variations in the available performance metrics as
a consequence of configuration changes are handled automatically and become
visible to all clients as soon as the reconfigured host is rebooted or
the responsible agent is restarted.</para>
<para>PCP also detects loss of client-server connections, and most clients
support subsequent automated reconnection.</para>

adaptive logging of performance metrics for archive, playback, remote

either at the host being monitored, at a monitoring workstation, or both.
</para>
<para>A universal replay mechanism, modeled on 
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_controls">media controls</ulink>,
supports play, step, rewind, fast forward and variable speed processing of archived
performance data. Replay for multiple archives, from multiple hosts, is facilitated
by an archive aggregation concept.</para>
<para>Most PCP applications are able to process archive logs and real-time
performance data with equal facility. Unification of real-time access
and access to the archive logs, in conjunction with the media controls,
provides powerful mechanisms for building performance tools and to review
both current and historical performance data.</para>

<primary>PCP</primary><secondary>extensibility</secondary></indexterm>PCP
permits the integration of new performance metrics into the PMNS, the

is, &#x201C;if it is important for monitoring system performance, and you
can measure it, you can easily integrate it into the PCP framework.&#x201D;
</para>
<para>For many PCP users, the most important performance metrics are
not those already supported, but new performance metrics that characterize
the essence of good or bad performance at their site, or within their
particular application environment.</para>
<para>One example is an application that measures the round-trip time
for a benign &#x201C;probe&#x201D; transaction against some mission-critical

easy-to-use insertion of trace and monitoring points within an application,
and the automatic export of resultant performance data into the PCP framework.
Other libraries and tools aid the development of customized and fully
featured Performance Metrics Domain Agents (PMDAs).</para>
<para>Extensive source code examples are provided in the distribution,

of performance or quality of service can be easily and seamlessly integrated

</primary><secondary>concept</secondary></indexterm> Across all of the
supported performance metric domains, there are a large number of performance
metrics. Each metric has its own structure and semantics. PCP presents
a uniform interface to these metrics, independent of the underlying metric
data source.</para>
<para><indexterm id="IG3137188864"><primary>PMNS</primary><secondary>brief description</secondary>
</indexterm>The Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) provides a hierarchical
classification of human-readable metric names, and a mapping from these external
names to internal metric identifiers. See <xref linkend="LE94677-PARENT"/>, for
a description of the PMNS.</para>
</section>
<section id="id5188440">

<title>Performance Metric Instances</title>
<para>When performance metric values are returned to a requesting application,
there may be more than one value instance for a particular metric; for
example, independent counts for each CPU, process, disk, or local filesystem.
Internal instance identifiers correspond one to one with external (human-readable)
descriptions of the members of an instance domain.</para>
<para>Transient performance metrics (such as per-process information)
cause repeated requests for the same metric to return different numbers
of values, or changes in the particular instance identifiers returned.
These changes are expected and fully supported by the PCP infrastructure;
however, metric instantiation is guaranteed to be valid only at the time of collection.</para>
</section>
<section id="id5188469">

<title>Current Metric Context</title>
<para>When performance metrics are retrieved, they are delivered in the
context of a particular source of metrics, a point in time, and a profile
of desired instances. This means that the application making the request
has already negotiated to establish the context in which the request should
be executed.</para>
<para><indexterm id="IG3137188865"><primary>pmlogger tool</primary><secondary>current metric
context</secondary></indexterm>A metric source may be the current performance
data from a particular host (a live or real-time source), or an archive
log of performance data collected by <command>pmlogger</command> at some
distant host or at an earlier time (a retrospective or archive source).
</para>
<para><indexterm id="ITch01-134"><primary>collection time</primary></indexterm>By
default, the collection time for a performance metric is the current time
of day for real-time sources, or current point within an archive source.
For archives, the collection time may be reset to an arbitrary time within
the bounds of the archive log.<indexterm id="ITch01-135"><primary>archive logs</primary>

<para>The number of performance metrics domains may be further enlarged
in cluster-based or network-based configurations, where there is potentially
an instance of each performance metrics domain on each node. Hence, the

<title>Values for Performance Metrics</title>
<para>The following sections describe two types of performance metrics,
single-valued and set-valued.</para>
<section id="id5189314">

<title>Single-Valued Performance Metrics</title>
<para><indexterm id="IG3137188877"><primary>single-valued performance metrics</primary>
</indexterm>Some performance metrics have a singular value within their
performance metric domains. For example, available memory (or the total
number of context switches) has only one value per performance metric
domain, that is, one value per host. The metadata describing the metric
makes this fact known to applications that process values for these metrics.
</para>
</section>
<section id="id5189346">

<title>Set-Valued Performance Metrics</title>
<para><indexterm id="IG3137188878"><primary>set-valued performance metrics</primary></indexterm>Some
performance metrics have a set of values or instances in each implementing
performance metric domain. For example, one value for each disk, one value
for each process, one value for each CPU, or one value for each activation
of a given application.</para>
<para>When a metric has multiple instances, the PCP framework does not
pollute the Name Space with additional metric names; rather, a single
metric may have an associated set of values. These multiple values are
associated with the members of an <firstterm>instance domain</firstterm>,
such that each instance has a unique instance identifier within the associated
instance domain. For example, the &#x201C;per CPU&#x201D; instance domain
may use the instance identifiers 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on to identify the
configured processors in the system.</para>
<para>Internally, instance identifiers are encoded as binary values, but
each performance metric domain also supports corresponding strings as
external names for the instance identifiers, and these names are used
at the user interface to the PCP utilities.</para>
<para>For example, the performance metric <literal>disk.dev.total</literal>
counts I/O operations for each disk spindle, and the associated instance
domain contains one member for each disk spindle. On a system with five
specific disks, one value would be associated with each of the external
and internal instance identifier pairs shown in <xref linkend="id5189432"/>.

<para>Multiple performance metrics may be associated with a single instance
domain.</para>
<para>Each performance metric domain may dynamically establish the instances
within an instance domain. For example, there may be one instance for
the metric <literal>kernel.percpu.idle</literal> on a workstation, but
multiple instances on a multiprocessor server. Even more dynamic is <literal>filesys.free</literal>, where the values report the amount of free space
per file system, and the number of values tracks the mounting and unmounting
of local filesystems.</para>
<para>PCP arranges for information describing instance domains to be exported
from the performance metric domains to the applications that require this
information. Applications may also choose to retrieve values for all instances
of a performance metric, or some arbitrary subset of the available instances.

<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>chkconfig pmcd on</userinput>&#xA0;
<userinput>${PCP_RC_DIR}/pmcd start</userinput>&#xA0;</literallayout>

</section>
<section id="LE58493-PARENT">

<title>Restarting an Unresponsive PMCD</title>
<para>Sometimes, if a daemon is not responding on a PCP collection system, the
problem can be resolved by stopping and then immediately restarting a fresh
instance of the daemon. If you need to stop and then immediately restart PMCD
on a PCP collection system, use the <literal>start</literal> argument provided
with the script in <filename>${PCP_RC_DIR}</filename>. The command syntax
is, as follows:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>${PCP_RC_DIR}/pmcd start</userinput>&#xA0;</literallayout>
<para>On startup, <command>pmcd</command> looks for a configuration file at
<filename>${PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH}</filename>. This file specifies which agents
cover which performance metrics domains and how PMCD should make contact with
the agents. A comprehensive description of the configuration file syntax and
semantics can be found in the <command>pmcd(1)</command> man page.
</para>
<para>If the configuration is changed, <command>pmcd</command> reconfigures
itself when it receives the <literal>SIGHUP</literal> signal. Use the following
command to send the <literal>SIGHUP</literal> signal to the daemon:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>${PCP_BINADM_DIR}/pmsignal -a -s HUP pmcd</userinput></literallayout>
<para>This is also useful when one of the PMDAs managed by <command>pmcd</command>
has failed or has been terminated by <command>pmcd</command>. Upon receipt
of the <literal>SIGHUP</literal> signal, <command>pmcd</command> restarts
any PMDA that is configured but inactive.  The exception to this rule is the
case of a PMDA which must run with superuser privileges (where possible, this
is avoided) - for these PMDAs, a full <command>pmcd</command> restart must be
performed, using the process described earlier (not SIGHUP).</para>

<para><indexterm id="ITch02-29"><primary>pmcd.conf file</primary></indexterm>When

This file contains entries that specify the PMDAs used by this instance of

access control rules in this file for the various hosts, users and groups on your network.

<para>With standard PCP operation (even if you have not created and added
your own PMDAs), you might need to edit this file in order to add any additional
access control you wish to impose. If you do not add access control rules, all access
for all operations is granted to the local host, and read-only access is granted to
remote hosts. The <filename>pmcd.conf</filename> file is automatically generated
during the software build process and on Linux, for example, is similar to the

<para>Each entry in this configuration file contains rules that specify how
to connect the PMCD to a particular PMDA and which metrics the PMDA monitors.
A PMDA may be attached as a Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) or by using a socket
or a pair of pipes. The distinction between these attachment methods is described
below.</para>

<para>The <replaceable>label_name</replaceable> field specifies a name for
the PMDA. The <replaceable>domain_number</replaceable> is an integer value

<para>The distributed PMNS used in PCP avoids most requirements for an
alternate PMNS, because clients' PMNS operations are supported at the
Performance Metrics Collection Daemon (PMCD) or by means of PMNS data
in a PCP archive log. The distributed PMNS is the default, but alternates
may be specified using the <command>-n</command> <replaceable>namespace</replaceable>

<primary>window options</primary></indexterm>The following options may
be used with most PCP tools (typically when the source of the performance
metrics is a PCP archive log) to tailor the beginning and end points of
a display, the sample origin, and the sample time alignment to your convenience.
</para>
<para>The <literal>-S</literal>, <literal>-T</literal>, <literal>-O</literal>
and <literal>-A</literal> command line options are used by PCP applications
to define a time window of interest.</para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>-S </literal> <replaceable>duration</replaceable></term>
<listitem><para>The start option may be used to request that the display
start at the nominated time. By default, the first sample of performance
data is retrieved immediately in real-time mode, or coincides with the
first sample of data in a PCP archive log in archive mode. For archive
mode, the <literal>-S</literal> option may be used to specify a later
time for the start of sampling. By default, if <replaceable>duration</replaceable>
is an integer, the units are assumed to be seconds.</para>
<para>To specify an offset from the beginning of a PCP archive (in archive
mode) simply specify the offset as the <replaceable>duration</replaceable>.
For example, the following entry retrieves the first sample of data at
exactly 30 minutes from the beginning of a PCP archive.</para>
<para><literallayout class="monospaced">-S 30min </literallayout></para>
<para>To specify an offset from the end of a PCP archive, prefix the
<replaceable>duration</replaceable> with a minus sign. In this case, the first sample
time precedes the end of archived data by the given <replaceable>duration</replaceable>.
For example, the following entry retrieves the first sample
exactly one hour preceding the last sample in a PCP archive.</para>
<para><literallayout class="monospaced">-S -1hour </literallayout></para>
<para>To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting
timezone) for the first sample, use the <literal>ctime(3)</literal> syntax
preceded by an &#x201C;at&#x201D; sign (@). For example, the following entry
specifies the date and time to be used.</para>
<para><literallayout class="monospaced">-S '@ Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 2013' </literallayout></para>
<para>Note that this format corresponds to the output format of the
<command>date</command> command for easy &#x201C;cut and paste.&#x201D; However,
be sure to enclose the string in quotes so it is preserved as a single
argument for the PCP tool.</para>
<para>For more complete information on the date and time syntax, see the <command>PCPIntro(1)</command> man page.</para>
</listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>-T </literal> <replaceable>duration</replaceable> </term>
<listitem><para>The terminate option may be used to request that the display
stop at the time designated by <replaceable>duration</replaceable>. By
default, the PCP tools keep sampling performance data indefinitely (in
real-time mode) or until the end of a PCP archive (in archive mode). The <literal>-T</literal> option may be used to specify an earlier time to terminate
sampling.</para>
<para>The interpretation for the <replaceable>duration</replaceable> argument
in a <literal>-T</literal> option is the same as for the <literal>-S</literal>
option, except for an unsigned time interval that is interpreted as being
an offset from the start of the time window as defined by the default
(now for real time, else start of archive) or by a <literal>-S</literal>
option. For example, these options define a time window that spans 45
minutes, after an initial offset (or delay) of 1 hour:<literallayout class="monospaced">-S 1hour -T 45mins</literallayout></para>
</listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>-O </literal> <replaceable>duration</replaceable></term>
<listitem><para>By default, samples are fetched from the start time (see
the description of the <literal>-S</literal> option) to the terminate
time (see the description of the <literal>-T</literal> option). The offset <literal>-O</literal> option allows the specification of a time between the start
time and the terminate time where the tool should position its initial
sample time. This option is useful when initial attention is focused at
some point within a larger time window of interest, or when one PCP tool
wishes to launch another PCP tool with a common current point of time
within a shared time window.</para>
<para>The <replaceable>duration</replaceable> argument accepted by <literal>-O</literal> conforms to the same syntax and semantics as the <replaceable>
duration</replaceable> argument for <literal>-T</literal>. For example,
these options specify that the initial position should be the end of the
time window:<literallayout class="monospaced">-O -0 </literallayout></para>
<para>This is most useful with the <command>pmchart</command> command
to display the tail-end of the history up to the end of the time window.
</para>
</listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><literal>-A </literal> <replaceable>alignment</replaceable></term>
<listitem><para>By default, performance data samples do not necessarily
happen at any natural unit of measured time. The <literal>-A</literal>
switch may be used to force the initial sample to be on the specified
<replaceable>alignment</replaceable>. For example, these three options specify alignment
on seconds, half hours, and whole hours:<literallayout class="monospaced">-A 1sec 
-A 30min 
-A 1hour</literallayout></para>
<para>The <literal>-A</literal> option advances the time to achieve the
desired alignment as soon as possible after the start of the time window,
whether this is the default window, or one specified with some combination
of <literal>-A</literal> and <literal>-O</literal> command line options.
</para>
</listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<para>Obviously the time window may be overspecified by using multiple
options from the set <literal>-t</literal>, <literal>-s</literal>, <literal>-S</literal>, <literal>-T</literal>, <literal>-A</literal>, and <literal>-O</literal>. Similarly, the time window may shrink to nothing by injudicious
choice of options.</para>
<para>In all cases, the parsing of these options applies heuristics guided
by the principal of &#x201C;least surprise&#x201D;; the time window is always
well-defined (with the end never earlier than the start), but may shrink
to nothing in the extreme.</para>

from an underlying instrumentation that is subject to asynchronous discontinuity.

connect to a remote PMCD on a system that is booting or at the other end
of a slow network link, some PMAPI routines could potentially block for
a long time until the remote system responds. These routines abort and
return an error if the connection has not been established after some
specified interval has elapsed. The default interval is 5 seconds. This
may be modified by setting this variable in the environment to a larger
number of seconds for the desired time out. This is most useful in cases
where the remote host is at the end of a slow network, requiring longer
latencies to establish the connection correctly.</para>

or client application loses its connection to a PMCD, the connection may
be reestablished by calling the <command>pmReconnectContext(3)</command>
PMAPI function. However, attempts to reconnect are controlled by a back-off
strategy to avoid flooding the network with reconnection requests. By
default, the back-off delays are 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 seconds for consecutive
reconnection requests from a client (the last delay is repeated for any
further attempts after the last delay in the list). Setting this environment
variable to a comma-separated list of positive integers redefines the
back-off delays. For example, setting the delays to <userinput>1,2</userinput>
will back off for 1 second, then back off every 2 seconds thereafter.

applications connected to PMCD, there is a possibility of the application
hanging on a request for performance metrics or metadata or help text.
These delays may become severe if the system running PMCD crashes or the
network connection is lost or the network link is very slow. By setting
this environment variable to a real number of seconds, requests to PMCD
timeout after the specified number of seconds. The default behavior is
to wait 10 seconds for a response from every PMCD for all applications.

<title>Transient Problems with Performance Metric Values
</title>
<para><indexterm id="IG31371888164"><primary>transient problems</primary></indexterm>Sometimes
the values for a performance metric as reported by a PCP tool appear to
be incorrect. This is typically caused by transient conditions such as
metric wraparound or time skew, described below. These conditions result
from design decisions that are biased in favor of lightweight protocols
and minimal resource demands for PCP components.</para>
<para>In all cases, these events are expected to occur infrequently, and
should not persist beyond a few samples.</para>

</primary></indexterm><indexterm id="IG31371888165"><primary>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP variable</primary>
</indexterm>Performance metrics are usually expressed as numbers with
finite precision. For metrics that are cumulative counters of events or
resource consumption, the value of the metric may occasionally overflow
the specified range and wraparound to zero.</para>
<para>Because the value of these counter metrics is computed from the
rate of change with respect to the previous sample, this may result in
a transient condition where the rate of change is an unknown value. If
the <literal>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</literal> environment variable is set, this
condition is treated as an overflow, and speculative rate calculations
are made. In either case, the correct rate calculation for the metric
returns with the next sample.</para>

<title>Time Dilation and Time Skew</title>
<para><indexterm id="ITch03-33"><primary>time dilation</primary></indexterm>If
a PMDA is tardy in returning results, or the PCP monitoring tool is connected
to PMCD via a slow or congested network, an error might be introduced
in rate calculations due to a difference between the time the metric was
sampled and the time PMCD sends the result to the monitoring tool.</para>
<para>In practice, these errors are usually so small as to be insignificant,
and the errors are self-correcting (not cumulative) over consecutive samples.
</para>
<para>A related problem may occur when the system time is not synchronized
between multiple hosts, and the time stamps for the results returned from
PMCD reflect the skew in the system times. In this case, it is recommended
that NTP (network time protocol) be used to keep the system clocks on the
collector systems synchronized;

<para>The <literal>-T</literal> option is extremely useful; it provides help
text about performance metrics:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo -T mem.util.cached</userinput>
mem.util.cached
Help:
Memory used by the page cache, including buffered file data.
This is in-memory cache for files read from the disk (the pagecache)
but doesn't include SwapCached.</literallayout>
<para>The <literal>-t</literal> option displays the one-line help text associated
with the selected metrics. The <literal>-T</literal> option prints more verbose
help text.</para>
<para>Without any options, <command>pminfo</command> verifies that the specified
metrics exist in the namespace, and echoes those names. Metrics may be specified
as arguments to <command>pminfo</command> using their full metric names. For
example, this command returns the following response:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo hinv.ncpu network.interface.total.bytes</userinput>
hinv.ncpu 
network.interface.total.bytes </literallayout>
<para>A group of related metrics in the namespace may also be specified.
For example, to list all of the <literal>hinv</literal> metrics you would
use this command:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo hinv</userinput>
hinv.physmem
hinv.pagesize
hinv.ncpu
hinv.ndisk
hinv.nfilesys
hinv.ninterface
hinv.nnode
hinv.machine
hinv.map.scsi
hinv.map.cpu_num
hinv.map.cpu_node
hinv.map.lvname
hinv.cpu.clock
hinv.cpu.vendor
hinv.cpu.model
hinv.cpu.stepping
hinv.cpu.cache
hinv.cpu.bogomips</literallayout>
<para>If no metrics are specified, <command>pminfo</command> displays the
entire collection of metrics. This can be useful for searching for metrics,
when only part of the full name is known. For example, this command returns
the following response:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo | grep nfs</userinput>
nfs.client.calls
nfs.client.reqs
nfs.server.calls
nfs.server.reqs
nfs3.client.calls
nfs3.client.reqs
nfs3.server.calls
nfs3.server.reqs
nfs4.client.calls
nfs4.client.reqs
nfs4.server.calls
nfs4.server.reqs</literallayout>
<para>The <literal>-d</literal> option causes <command>pminfo</command> to
display descriptive information about metrics (refer to the <command>pmLookupDesc(3)</command>
man page for an explanation of this metadata information).
The following command and response show use of the <literal>-d</literal> option:
</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo -d proc.nprocs disk.dev.read filesys.free</userinput>
proc.nprocs
    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: discrete  Units: none

disk.dev.read
    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: 60.1 0xf000001

filesys.free
    Data Type: 64-bit unsigned int  InDom: 60.5 0xf000005
    Semantics: instant  Units: Kbyte</literallayout>
<para>The <literal>-f</literal> option to <command>pminfo</command> forces
the current value of each named metric to be fetched and printed. In the example
below, all metrics in the group <literal>hinv</literal> are selected:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo -f hinv</userinput>

<para>The <literal>-h</literal> option directs <command>pminfo</command> to
retrieve information from the specified host. If the metric has an instance
domain, the value associated with each instance of the metric is printed:

<para><indexterm id="IG31371888174"><primary>PMID</primary><secondary>printing</secondary></indexterm>The <literal>-m</literal> option prints the Performance Metric Identifiers (PMIDs) of the
selected metrics. This is useful for finding out which PMDA supplies the metric.
For example, the output below identifies the PMDA supporting domain 4 (the

<para><indexterm id="ITch04-26"><primary>pmstore tool</primary><secondary>
description</secondary></indexterm>From time to time you may wish to change
the value of a particular metric. Some metrics are counters that may need
to be reset, and some are simply control variables for agents that collect
performance metrics. When you need to change the value of a metric for any
reason, the command to use is <command>pmstore</command>.</para>
<note><para>For obvious reasons, the ability to arbitrarily change the value
of a performance metric is not supported. Rather, PCP collectors selectively
allow some metrics to be modified in a very controlled fashion.</para>
</note>
<para>The basic syntax of the command is as follows:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced">pmstore <replaceable>metricname</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable>&#xA0;</literallayout>
<para>There are also command line flags to further specify the action. For
example, the <literal>-i</literal> option restricts the change to one or more
instances of the performance metric.</para>
<para>The <replaceable>value</replaceable> may be in one of several forms,
according to the following rules:</para>
<orderedlist><listitem><para>If the metric has an integer type, then
<replaceable>value</replaceable> should consist of an optional leading hyphen, followed
either by decimal digits or &#x201C;0x&#x201D; and some hexadecimal digits; &#x201C;0X&#x201D;
is also acceptable instead of &#x201C;0x.&#x201D;</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>If the metric has a floating point type, then
<replaceable>value</replaceable> should be in the form of an integer (described above),
a fixed point number, or a number in scientific notation.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>If the metric has a string type, then
<replaceable>value</replaceable> is interpreted as a literal string of ASCII characters.
</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>If the metric has an aggregate type, then an attempt
is made to interpret <replaceable>value</replaceable> as an integer, a floating
point number, or a string. In the first two cases, the minimal word length
encoding is used; for example, &#x201C;123&#x201D; would be interpreted as a
four-byte aggregate, and &#x201C;0x100000000&#x201D; would be interpreted as
an eight-byte aggregate.</para>
</listitem></orderedlist>
<para>The following example illustrates the use of <command>pmstore</command>
to enable performance metrics collection in the <literal>txmon</literal>&#xA0;PMDA
(see <literal>${PCP_PMDAS_DIR}/txmon</literal> for the source code of the txmon
PMDA). When the metric <literal>txmon.control.level</literal> has the value

(PCP) is provided by the Performance Metrics Inference Engine, (<command>pmie</command>),
which is an applied artificial intelligence application.
</para>
<para>The <command>pmie</command> tool accepts expressions describing adverse
performance scenarios, and periodically evaluates these against streams of
performance metric values from one or more sources. When an expression is
found to be true, <command>pmie</command> is able to execute arbitrary actions
to alert or notify the system administrator of the occurrence of an adverse
performance scenario. These facilities are very general, and are designed
to accommodate the automated execution of a mixture of generic and site-specific
performance monitoring and control functions.</para>
<para>The stream of performance metrics to be evaluated may be from one or
more hosts, or from one or more PCP archive logs. In the latter case, <command>pmie</command>
may be used to retrospectively identify adverse performance conditions.</para>

<para>The power of <command>pmie</command> may be harnessed to automate the
most common of the deterministic system management functions that are responses
to changes in system performance. For example, disable a batch stream if the
DBMS transaction commit response time at the ninetieth percentile goes over
two seconds, or stop accepting uploads and send e-mail to the <replaceable>sysadmin</replaceable>
alias if free space in a storage system falls below five percent.</para>
<para>Moreover, the power of <command>pmie</command> can be directed towards
the exceptional and sporadic performance problems. For example, if a network
packet storm is expected, enable IP header tracing for ten seconds, and send
e-mail to advise that data has been collected and is awaiting analysis. Or,
if production batch throughput falls below 50 jobs per minute, activate a pager
to the systems administrator on duty.</para>

<para><indexterm id="ITch06-7"><primary>PCP</primary><secondary>pmie tool
</secondary></indexterm>Before you use <command>pmie</command>, it
is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the concepts from
the <xref linkend="LE79836-PARENT"/>. The discussion in this section serves
as a very brief review of these concepts.</para>
<para><indexterm id="IG31371888187"><primary>pminfo tool</primary><secondary>pmie arguments</secondary>
</indexterm>PCP makes available thousands of performance metrics that
you can use when formulating expressions for <command>pmie</command> to evaluate.
If you want to find out which metrics are currently available on your system,
use this command:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo</userinput>&#xA0;</literallayout>
<para>Use the <command>pmie</command> command line arguments to find out more
about a particular metric. In <xref linkend="Z983825969sdc"/>, to fetch new

with the <literal>-f</literal> Option</title>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>pminfo -f -h dove disk.dev.total</userinput></literallayout>

or count/second), while instantaneous values such as <literal>mem.util.cached</literal>
are not subjected to rate conversion. Metrics with an instance
domain (<literal>InDom</literal> in the <command>pminfo</command> output)
of <literal>PM_INDOM_NULL</literal> are singular and always produce one value
per source. However, a metric like <literal>kernel.percpu.cpu.user</literal>
has an instance domain, and may produce multiple values per source (in this
case, it is one value for each configured CPU).</para>

in this case <literal>disk.dev.total</literal>, collected from the local PMCD:
</para>

</example>
<para>On this system, there are two disk spindles, hence two values of the
expression <command>iops</command> per sample. Notice that the values for
the first sample are unknown (represented by the question marks [?] in the
first line of output), because rates can be computed only when at least two
samples are available. The subsequent samples are produced every ten seconds
by default. The second sample reports that during the preceding ten seconds
there was an average of 14.4 transfers per second on one disk and no transfers
on the other disk.</para>
<para>Rates are computed using time stamps delivered by PMCD. Due to unavoidable
inaccuracy in the actual sampling time (the sample interval is not exactly
10 seconds), you may see more decimal places in values than you expect. Notice,
however, that these errors do not accumulate but cancel each other out over
subsequent samples.</para>
<para>In <xref linkend="Z983823607sdc"/>, the expression to be evaluated was
entered using the keyboard, followed by the end-of-file character [<keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>D</keycap>].
Usually, it is more convenient to enter expressions
into a file (for example, <filename>myrules</filename>) and ask <command>pmie</command>

<literallayout class="monospaced">(disk.all.write / disk.all.total) * 100; </literallayout>
<para>The <literal>disk.all</literal> metrics are singular, so this expression

</para>
<note><para>If there is no disk activity,<literal>&#xA0;disk.all.total</literal>
will be zero and <command>pmie</command> evaluates this expression to be not

</note>
<para>The following logical expression has the value <literal>true</literal>
or <literal>false</literal> for each disk:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced">disk.dev.total &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; 
disk.dev.write &gt; disk.dev.read; </literallayout>
<para>The value is true if the number of writes exceeds the number of reads,

log). To specify a single value for some performance metric requires the metric
name to be associated with all three of the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>

<primary>operators</primary></indexterm>Boolean and relational operators may
accept set-valued operands and produce set-valued results. In many cases,
rules that are appropriate for performance management require a set of truth
values to be reduced along one or more of the dimensions of hosts, instances,
and sample times described in <xref linkend="LE73508-PARENT"/>.
The <command>pmie</command> quantification operators perform this function.</para>
<para>Each quantification operator takes a one-, two-, or three-dimension
set of truth values as an operand, and reduces it to a set of smaller dimension,
by quantification along a single dimension. For example, suppose the expression
in the previous example is simplified and prefixed by <literal>some_sample</literal>, to produce the following expression:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced"><userinput>intfs = &quot;#eth0 #eth2&quot;;</userinput>&#xA0;
<userinput>all_intf = some_sample network.interface.in.packets</userinput>
                     <userinput>$intfs @0..2 &gt; 300 count/sec;</userinput></literallayout>
<para>Then the expression result is reduced from six values to two (one per
interface instance), such that the result for a particular instance will be
false unless the relational expression for the same interface instance is
true for at least one of the preceding three sample times.</para>
<para>There are existential, universal, and percentile quantification operators
in each of the <replaceable>host</replaceable>, <replaceable>instance</replaceable>,

<para>These operators may be nested. For example, the following expression
answers the question: &#x201C;Are all hosts experiencing at least 20% of their
disks busy either reading or writing?&#x201D;</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Servers = &quot;:moomba :babylon&quot;;
all_host ( 
    20%_inst disk.dev.read $Servers &gt; 40 || 
    20%_inst disk.dev.write $Servers &gt; 40
); </literallayout>
<para>The following expression uses different syntax to encode the same semantics:
</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced">all_host (
    20%_inst (
        disk.dev.read $Servers &gt; 40 ||
        disk.dev.write $Servers &gt; 40
    )
);</literallayout>
<note><para>To avoid confusion over precedence and scope for the quantification
operators, use explicit parentheses.</para>
</note>
<para>Two additional quantification operators are available for the instance
dimension only, namely <literal>match_inst</literal> and <literal>nomatch_inst</literal>, that take a regular expression and a boolean expression. The result
is the boolean AND of the expression and the result of matching (or not matching)
the associated instance name against the regular expression.</para>
<para>For example, this rule evaluates error rates on various 10BaseT Ethernet
network interfaces (such as ecN, ethN, or efN):</para>

cumulative counters may occasionally overflow their range and wraparound to
0. When this happens, an unknown value (printed as <literal>?</literal>) is
returned as the value of the metric for one sample (recall that the value
returned is normally a rate). You can have PCP interpolate a value based on
expected rate of change by setting the <literal>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</literal>

long enough, particularly in the case of rates, to ensure that a meaningful
value is computed. Interval may vary according to the metric and your needs.
A reasonable minimum is in the range of ten seconds or several minutes. Although
PCP supports sampling rates up to hundreds of times per second, using
small sample intervals creates unnecessary load on the monitored system.</para>

</indexterm>One of the most important applications of archive logging services
provided by PCP is in the area of retrospective analysis. In many cases, understanding
today's performance problems can be assisted by side-by-side comparisons with
yesterday's performance. With routine creation of performance archive logs,
you can concurrently replay pictures of system performance for two or more
periods in the past.</para>
<para>Archive logs are also an invaluable source of intelligence when trying
to diagnose what went wrong, as in a performance post-mortem. Because the PCP
archive logs are entirely self-contained, this analysis can be performed off-site
if necessary.</para>
<para>Each archive log contains metric values from only one host. However,
many PCP tools can simultaneously visualize values from multiple archives
collected from different hosts.</para>
<para>The archives can be replayed using the inference engine (<command>pmie</command>
is an application that uses the PMAPI). This allows you to
automate the regular, first-level analysis of system performance.</para>
<para>Such analysis can be performed by constructing suitable expressions
to capture the essence of common resource saturation problems, then periodically
creating an archive and playing it against the expressions. For example, you
may wish to create a daily performance audit (perhaps run by the <command>cron</command>
command) to detect performance regressions.</para>

that is incremented with each volume change. For example, you might have a

<title>Basenames for Managed Archive Log Files</title>
<para>The PCP archive management tools support a consistent scheme for selecting
the basenames for the files in a collection of archives and for mapping these
files to a suitable directory hierarchy.</para>
<para>Once configured, the PCP tools that manage archive logs employ a consistent
scheme for selecting the basename for an archive each time <command>pmlogger</command>
is launched, namely the current date and time in the format YYYYMMDD.HH.MM.
Typically, at the end of each day, all archives for a particular host on that
day would be merged to produce a single archive with a basename constructed
from the date, namely YYYYMMDD. The <literal>pmlogger_daily</literal> script
performs this action and a number of other routine housekeeping chores.</para>

<title>Directory Organization for Archive Log Files</title>
<para>If you are using a deployment of PCP tools and daemons to collect metrics
from a variety of hosts and storing them all at a central location, you should
develop an organized strategy for storing and naming your log files.</para>
<note><para><indexterm id="IG31371888265"><primary>pmchart tool</primary><secondary>short-term
executions</secondary></indexterm>There are many possible configurations of <command>pmlogger</command>,
as described in <xref linkend="LE56598-PARENT"/>. The directory
organization described in this section is recommended for any system on which
<command>pmlogger</command> is configured for permanent execution (as opposed to short-term
executions, for example, as launched from <command>pmchart</command> to record
some performance data of current interest).</para>
</note>
<para>Typically, the filesystem structure can be used to reflect the
number of hosts for which a <command>pmlogger</command> instance is expected
to be running locally, obviating the need for lengthy and cumbersome filenames.
It makes considerable sense to place all logs for a particular host in a separate
directory named after that host. Because each instance of <command>pmlogger</command>
can only log metrics fetched from a single host, this also simplifies
some of the archive log management and administration tasks.</para>
<para>For example, consider the filesystem and naming structure shown in <xref linkend="id5207462"/>.</para>
<figure id="id5207462"><title>Archive Log Directory Structure</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/log-directory.svg"/></imageobject><textobject><phrase>Archive Log Directory Structure</phrase></textobject></mediaobject></figure>
<para><indexterm id="IG31371888266"><primary>${PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH} file</primary>

particular <command>pmlogger</command> instances is encoded in the configuration
file <filename>${PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH}</filename>,
and this file should be customized on each host running an instance of <command>pmlogger</command>.</para>
<para>If many archives are being created, and the associated PCP collector
systems form peer classes based upon service type (Web servers,
DBMS servers, NFS servers, and so on), then it may be appropriate to introduce
another layer into the directory structure, or use symbolic links to group
together hosts providing similar service types.</para>

describe which metrics are to be logged. Groups of metrics may
be logged at different intervals to other groups of metrics. Two states, mandatory

definitely should be logged or not logged, or whether a later advisory definition
may change that state.</para>
<para>The mandatory state takes precedence if it is <literal>on</literal>
or <literal>off</literal>, causing any subsequent request for a change in
advisory state to have no effect. If the mandatory state is <literal>maybe</literal>,
then the advisory state determines if logging is enabled or not.
</para>
<para>The mandatory states are <literal>on</literal>, <literal>off</literal>,
and <literal>maybe</literal>. The advisory states, which only affect metrics
that are mandatory <literal>maybe</literal>, are <literal>on</literal> and
<literal>off</literal>. Therefore, a metric that is mandatory <literal>maybe</literal>
in one definition and advisory <literal>on</literal> in another definition
would be logged at the advisory interval. Metrics that are not specified in

monitoring utilities</secondary></indexterm>The most common use of performance
monitoring utilities is a scenario where the PCP tools are executed on
a workstation (the PCP monitoring system), while the interesting performance
data is collected on remote systems (PCP collector systems) by a number
of processes, specifically the Performance Metrics Collection Daemon (PMCD)
and the associated Performance Metrics Domain Agents (PMDAs). These processes
can execute on both the monitoring system and one or more collector systems,
or only on collector systems. However, collector systems are the real
objects of performance investigations.</para>

<title>Basic Deployment</title>
<para>In the simplest PCP deployment, one system is configured as both
a collector and a monitor, as shown in <xref linkend="id5210776"/>.
Because some of the PCP monitor tools make extensive use of visualization, this
suggests the monitor system should be configured with a graphical display.</para>

<para>However, most PCP deployments involve at least two systems. For

<para>But the most common site configuration would include a mixture of
systems configured as PCP collectors, as PCP monitors, and as both PCP
monitors and collectors, as shown in <xref linkend="id5210866"/>.</para>
<para>With one or more PCP collector systems and one or more PCP monitor
systems, there are a number of decisions that need to be made regarding
the deployment of PCP services across multiple hosts. For example, in <xref linkend="id5210866"/>
there are several ways in which both the inference engine (<command>pmie</command>)
and the PCP archive logger (<command>pmlogger</command>) could be deployed.

<title>Resource Demands for the Deployment Options</title>
<para>The <command>pmlogger</command> process is very lightweight in terms
of computational demand; most of the (very small) CPU cost is associated with
extracting performance metrics at the PCP collector system (PMCD and the
PMDAs), which are independent of the host on which <command>pmlogger</command>
is running.</para>
<para>A local <command>pmlogger</command> consumes disk bandwidth and
disk space on the PCP collector system. A remote <command>pmlogger</command>
consumes disk space on the site where it is running and network bandwidth
between that host and the PCP collector host.</para>
<para>The archive logs typically grow at a rate of anywhere between a few
kilobytes (KB) to tens of megabytes (MB) per day, depending on how many
performance metrics are logged and the choice of sampling frequencies.
There are some advantages in minimizing the number of hosts over which the
disk resources for PCP archive logs must be allocated; however, the aggregate
requirement is independent of where the <command>pmlogger</command> processes
are running.</para>

<section id="id5211489">

<title>Operational Management</title>
<para>There is an initial administrative cost associated with configuring
each <command>pmlogger</command> instance, and an ongoing administrative

(such as rotation, compression, and culling of PCP archive log files),
and execute periodic tasks to process the archives (such as nightly performance
regression checking with <command>pmie</command>).</para>
<para>Many of these tasks are handled by the supplied <command>pmlogger</command>

a host different from the one they were created on.</para>
<para>NFS mounting is obviously an option, but the PCP tools support random
access and both forward and backward temporal motion within an archive

Co-Pilot (PCP) has been designed and implemented with a philosophy that embraces
the notion of toolkits and encourages extensibility.</para>
<para>In most cases, the PCP tools provide orthogonal services, based on external
configuration files. It is the creation of new and modified configuration
files that enables PCP users to customize tools quickly and meet the needs
of the local environment, in many cases allowing personal preferences to be
established for individual users on the same PCP monitor system.</para>
<para>The material in this section is intended to act as a checklist of pointers
to detailed documentation found elsewhere in this guide, in the man pages,
and in the files that are made available as part of the PCP installation.

<title>PMNS Management</title>
<para><indexterm id="IG31371888322"><primary>PMNS</primary><secondary>management</secondary>
</indexterm>This section describes the syntax, semantics, and processing framework
for the external specification of a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS)
as it might be loaded by the PMAPI routine <command>pmLoadNameSpace</command>;
see the <command>pmLoadNameSpace(3)</command> man page. This is usually done only
by <command>pmcd</command>, except in rare circumstances such as <xref linkend="LE43074-PARENT"/>.
</para>
<para>The PMNS specification is a simple text source file that can be edited
easily. For reasons of efficiency, a binary format is also supported; the
utility <literal>pmnscomp</literal> translates the ASCII source format into
binary format; see the <command>pmnscomp(1)</command> man page.
</para>
<section id="id5213650">

<title>PMNS Processing Framework</title>
<para>The PMNS specification is initially passed through <command>pmcpp(1)</command>.
This means the following facilities may be used in the specification:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>C-style comments</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para><literal>#include</literal> directives</para>

<title>PMNS Syntax</title>
<para><indexterm id="ITch09-4"><primary>PMNS</primary><secondary>syntax</secondary>
</indexterm><indexterm id="IG31371888323"><primary>syntax</primary></indexterm>Every PMNS is
tree structured. The paths to the leaf nodes are the performance metric names.
The general syntax for a non-leaf node in PMNS is as follows:</para>
<literallayout class="monospaced">pathname {
        name    [pmid]
        ...
}</literallayout>
<para>Here <literal>pathname</literal> is the full pathname from the root
of the PMNS to this non-leaf node, with each component in the path separated
by a period. The root node for the PMNS has the special name <literal>root</literal>, but the prefix string <literal>root.</literal> must be omitted
from all other <literal>pathnames</literal>.</para>
<para>For example, refer to the PMNS shown in <xref linkend="id5213846"/>.
The correct pathname for the rightmost non-leaf node is <literal>cpu.utilization</literal>, not <literal>root.cpu.utilization</literal>.</para>
<figure id="id5213846"><title>Small Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS)</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="images/pmns-small2.svg"/></imageobject><textobject><phrase>Small Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS)</phrase></textobject></mediaobject></figure>
<para>Each component in the pathname must begin with an alphabetic character
and be followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or the underscore
(_) character. For alphabetic characters in a component, uppercase and lowercase
are significant.</para>
<para>Non-leaf nodes in the PMNS may be defined in any order desired. The
descendent nodes are defined by the set of <literal>names</literal>, relative
to the pathname of their parent non-leaf node. For descendent nodes, leaf
nodes have a <literal>pmid</literal> specification, but non-leaf nodes do
not.</para>
<para>The syntax for the <literal>pmid</literal> specification was chosen
to help manage the allocation of Performance Metric IDs (PMIDs) across disjoint
and autonomous domains of administration and implementation. Each <literal>pmid</literal> consists of three integers separated by colons, for example, <literal>14:27:11</literal>. This is intended to mirror the implementation hierarchy
of performance metrics. The first integer identifies the domain in which the
performance metric lies. Within a domain, related metrics are often grouped
into clusters. The second integer identifies the cluster, and the third integer,
the metric within the cluster.</para>
<para>The PMNS specification for <xref linkend="id5213846"/> is shown in <xref linkend="Z928447759sdc"/>:</para>
