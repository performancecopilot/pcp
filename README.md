Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) provides a framework and services to support
system-level performance monitoring and management. It presents a unifying
abstraction for all of the performance data in a system, and many tools
for interrogating, retrieving and processing that data.

PCP is a feature-rich, mature, extensible, cross-platform toolkit
supporting both live and retrospective analysis. The distributed PCP
architecture makes it especially useful for those seeking centralized
monitoring of distributed processing.

See the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file for build, installation and configuration steps.
