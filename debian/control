Description: Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) manager daemon
 An optional daemon (pmmgr) that manages a collection of pmlogger and
 pmie daemons, for a set of discovered local and remote hosts running
 the performance metrics collection daemon (pmcd).  It ensures these

 needs (which are particularly complex in the case of pmlogger).

 scripts which predate this daemon but do still provide effective and
 efficient log management services.
