# Note: [port] 26 below is unassigned by IANA although
# 	http://www.speedguide.net reports it may be used for RSFTP (simple
# 	FTP-like service) and perhaps an SMTP alternate ... for our
# 	purposes we're looking for a port that has no one listening
# 	on the remote end
# Another note: some firewalls will respond with "No route to host"
# 	rather than "Connection refused", so treat these as equivalent
