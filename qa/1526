# PCP QA Test No. 1526
# QA environment prober ...
#
# Normally this does nothing and says nothing.  But it provides a hook
# for exploring the environment where QA is run, especially useful for
# VMs and containers in github's CI infrastructure.
#
# If the "hook" is being used, it _must_ generate something on stdout
# and then $seq.out and/or $seq.full may be used to deliver the probe's
# payload.
