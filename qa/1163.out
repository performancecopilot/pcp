PMID: 2.0.7 [PMCD version]
PMID: 2.0.16 [host from which active pmlogger is fetching metrics]
PMID: 2.0.16
This metric encodes the current status of each PMDA.  The default value
is 0 if the PMDA is active.

Other values encode various degrees of PMDA difficulty in three bit fields
(bit 0 is the low-order bit) as follows:

bits 7..0
    1   the PMDA is connected, but not yet "ready" to accept requests
        from the PMDA
    2   the PMDA has exited of its own accord
    4   some error prevented the PMDA being started
    8   PMCD stopped communication with the PMDA due to a protocol or
        timeout error

bits 15..8
        the exit() status from the PMDA

bits 23..16
        the number of the signal that terminated the PMDA
PMID: 2.0.20 [rewritten]
PMID: 2.0.20

PMID: 2.3.1
The fully qualified domain name of the host from which a pmlogger
instance is fetching metrics to be archived.

The instance names are process IDs of the active pmloggers.  The
primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the instance name "primary"
and an instance id of zero (in addition to its normal process id
instance).

Metric Help Text in the Log ...
PMID: 2.0.2 [Number of agents (PMDAs) currently connected to PMCD]
PMID: 2.0.2
The number of agents (PMDAs) currently connected to PMCD.  This may differ
from the number of agents configured in $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH if agents have
terminated and/or been timed-out by PMCD.
PMID: 2.0.3
The number of connections open to client programs retrieving information
from PMCD.
PMID: 2.0.7 [PMCD version]
PMID: 2.0.16 [running PCP services on the local host]
PMID: 2.0.20 [build version for installed PCP package]
PMID: 2.3.1 [host from which active pmlogger is fetching metrics]
PMID: 2.3.1
The fully qualified domain name of the host from which a pmlogger
instance is fetching metrics to be archived.

The instance names are process IDs of the active pmloggers.  The
primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the instance name "primary"
and an instance id of zero (in addition to its normal process id
instance).
PMID: 2.4.1 [PMDA status]
PMID: 2.4.1
This metric encodes the current status of each PMDA.  The default value
is 0 if the PMDA is active.

Other values encode various degrees of PMDA difficulty in three bit fields
(bit 0 is the low-order bit) as follows:

bits 7..0
    1   the PMDA is connected, but not yet "ready" to accept requests
        from the PMDA
    2   the PMDA has exited of its own accord
    4   some error prevented the PMDA being started
    8   PMCD stopped communication with the PMDA due to a protocol or
        timeout error

bits 15..8
        the exit() status from the PMDA

bits 23..16
        the number of the signal that terminated the PMDA
PMID: 2.5.0 [configuration file name]
PMID: 2.5.0
The full path in the filesystem to the configuration file containing the
rules being evaluated by each pmie instance.

If the configuration file was supplied on the standard input, then this
metric will have the value "<stdin>".  If multiple configuration files were
given to pmie, then the value of this metric will be the first configuration
file specified.
PMID: 2.5.1 [filename of pmie instance event log]
PMID: 2.5.1
The file to which each instance of pmie is writting events.  No two pmie
instances can share the same log file.  If no logfile was specified when
pmie was started, this metrics has the value "<none>".  All daemon pmie
instances started through pmie_check(1) must have an associated log file.
PMID: 2.5.2 [default hostname for pmie instance]
PMID: 2.5.2
The default host from which pmie is fetching metrics.  This is either the
hostname given to pmie on the command line or the local host.  Note that this
does not consider host names specified in the pmie configuration file (these
are considered non-default and can be more than one per pmie instance).
All daemon pmie instances started through pmie_check(1) will have their
default host passed in on their command line.
PMID: 2.5.3 [number of rules being evaluated]
PMID: 2.5.3
The total number of rules being evaluated by each pmie process.
PMID: 2.5.4 [count of rules evaluating to true]
PMID: 2.5.4
A cumulative count of the evaluated pmie rules which have evaluated to true.

This value is incremented once each time an action is executed.  This value
will always be less than or equal to pmcd.pmie.eval.true because predicates
which have evaluated to true may be suppressed in the action part of the
pmie rule, in which case this counter will not be incremented.
PMID: 2.5.5 [count of pmie predicates evaluated to true]
PMID: 2.5.5
The predicate part of a pmie rule can be said to evaluate to either true,
false, or not known.  This metric is a cumulative count of the number of
rules which have evaluated to true for each pmie instance.
PMID: 2.5.6 [count of pmie predicates evaluated to false]
PMID: 2.5.6
The predicate part of a pmie rule can be said to evaluate to either true,
false, or not known.  This metric is a cumulative count of the number of
rules which have evaluated to false for each pmie instance.
PMID: 2.5.7 [count of pmie predicates not evaluated]
PMID: 2.5.7
The predicate part of a pmie rule can be said to evaluate to either true,
false, or not known.  This metric is a cumulative count of the number of
rules which have not been successfully evaluated.  This could be due to not
yet having sufficient values to evaluate the rule, or a metric fetch may
have been unsuccessful in retrieving current values for metrics required
for evaluation of the rule.
PMID: 2.5.8 [expected rate of rule evaluations]
PMID: 2.5.8
This is the expected rate of evaluation of pmie rules.  The value is
calculated once when pmie starts, and is the number of pmie rules divided
by the average time interval over which they are to be evaluated.
PMID: 2.5.9 [count of actual rule evaluations]
PMID: 2.5.9
A cumulative count of the pmie rules which have been evaluated.

This value is incremented once for each evaluation of each rule.

PMID: 3.32.4 [physical device read bytes]
PMID: 3.32.4
Number of bytes physically read on by devices on behalf of this process.

PMID: 3.32.5 [physical device write bytes]
PMID: 3.32.5
Number of bytes physically written to devices on behalf of this process.
This must be reduced by any truncated I/O (proc.io.cancelled_write_bytes).

PMID: 3.32.6 [physical device write cancelled bytes]

PMID: 11.16.33 [number of buffer writes going to the disk from the log]
PMID: 11.16.33
This variable counts the number of log buffer writes going to the
physical log partitions of XFS filesystems. Log data traffic is
proportional to the level of meta-data updating. Log buffer writes get
generated when they fill up or external syncs occur.
PMID: 11.16.34 [write throughput to the physical XFS log]
PMID: 11.16.34
This variable counts the number of Kbytes of information being written
to the physical log partitions of XFS filesystems. Log data traffic
is proportional to the level of meta-data updating. The rate with which
log data gets written depends on the size of internal log buffers and
disk write speed. Therefore, filesystems with very high meta-data
updating may need to stripe the log partition or put the log partition
on a separate drive.
PMID: 11.16.35 [count of failures for immediate get of buffered/internal]
PMID: 11.16.35
This variable keeps track of times when a logged transaction can not
get any log buffer space. When this occurs, all of the internal log
buffers are busy flushing their data to the physical on-disk log.

PMID: 60.0.72 [per-disk raw count of read response time]
PMID: 60.0.72
For each completed read on each disk the response time (queue time plus
service time) in milliseconds is added to the associated instance of
this metric.

When converted to a normalized rate, the value represents the time average
of the number of outstanding reads for a disk.  When divided by the number
of completed reads for a disk (disk.dev.read), the value represents the
stochastic average of the read response (or wait) time for that disk.

It is suitable mainly for use in calculations with other metrics,
e.g. mirroring the results from existing performance tools:

 iostat.dev.r_await = delta(disk.dev.read_rawactive) / delta(disk.dev.read)

PMID: 60.1.16
This is apparently an i386 specific metric, and seems to be always zero
on ia64 architecture (and possibly others). On i386 arch (at least),
highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory. Highmem areas
are for use by userspace programs, or for the pagecache. The kernel
must use tricks to access this memory, making it slower to access
than lowmem.

See mem.util.highTotal. Not used on ia64 arch (and possibly others).
PMID: 60.1.18 [Kbytes in low memory total, from /proc/meminfo]
PMID: 60.1.18
Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that highmem can be
used for, but it is also availble for the kernel's use for its own
data structures. Among many other things, it is where everything
from the Slab is allocated.  Bad things happen when you're out of lowmem.

An estimate of how much RAM you would need to make a 99.99% guarantee
that there never is OOM (out of memory) for this workload. Normally
the kernel will overcommit memory. That means, say you do a 1GB malloc,
nothing happens, really. Only when you start USING that malloc memory
you will get real memory on demand, and just as much as you use.

PMID: 60.10.11 [per-disk-partition device count of active time]
PMID: 60.10.11
Counts the number of milliseconds for which at least one I/O is in
progress for each disk partition.

When converted to a rate, this metric represents the average utilization
of the disk partition during the sampling interval.  A value of 0.5
(or 50%) means the disk partition was active (i.e. busy) half the time.
PMID: 60.10.12 [per-disk-partition device time averaged count of request queue length]
PMID: 60.10.13 [per-disk-partition raw count of read response time]
PMID: 60.10.13
For each completed read on each disk partition the response time
(queue time plus service time) in milliseconds is added to the associated
instance of this metric.

When converted to a normalized rate, the value represents the time average
of the number of outstanding reads for a disk partition.  When divided by
the number of completed reads for a disk partition (disk.partitions.read),
the value represents the stochastic average of the read response (or wait)
time for that disk partition.

It is suitable mainly for use in calculations with other metrics,
e.g. mirroring the results from existing performance tools:

 iostat.partitions.r_await = delta(disk.partitions.read_rawactive) /
                             delta(disk.partitions.read)

PMID: 60.36.38
Maximum memory bandwidth supported on each numa node. It makes use of a
bandwith.conf file which has the bandwidth information for each node :
node_num:bandwidth
The node_num must match with any node in sysfs/devices/system/node directory.
And, the bandwidth is expressed in terms of MBps. This config file should be
filled up manually after running some bandwidth saturation benchmark tools.

Counts the number of milliseconds for which at least one I/O is in
progress for each device-mapper device.

When converted to a rate, this metric represents the average utilization
of the device during the sampling interval.  A value of 0.5 (or 50%)
means the device was active (i.e. busy) half the time.

PMID: 60.54.14
For each completed read on each device-mapper device the response time
(queue time plus service time) in milliseconds is added to the associated
instance of this metric.

When converted to a normalized rate, the value represents the time
average of the number of outstanding reads for a device-mapper device.
When divided by the number of completed reads for a device-mapper device
(disk.dm.read), the value represents the stochastic average of the read
response (or wait) time for that device.

It is suitable mainly for use in calculations with other metrics,
e.g. mirroring the results from existing performance tools:

InDom: 2.1 [Instance domain "pmloggers" from PMCD PMDA]
InDom: 2.1
This is the list of currently active pmlogger instances on the same
machine as this PMCD.  The instance names are the process IDs of the
pmlogger instances.  The primary pmlogger has an extra instance with the
instance name "primary" and an instance id of zero (in addition to its
normal process id instance).
InDom: 2.3
One instance per PMDA managed by PMCD.  The external and internal instance
identifiers are taken from the first two fields of the PMDA specification
in $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH.
