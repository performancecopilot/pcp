infiniband.port.in.bytes PMID: 91.1.0 [Bytes received]
    Data Type: 64-bit int  InDom: 91.1 0x16c00001
    Semantics: counter  Units: byte
Help:
Counter of data octets received on all VLs at the port. This 
includes all octets between (and not including) the start of 
packet delimiter and the VCRC, and may include packets containing errors.
It excludes all link packets. 

This counter is implemented by sampling underlying saturating PortRcvData 
counter. When a value of saturated counter reaches predefined threshold,
the counter is reset after its value is copied into internal state.

infiniband.port.out.bytes PMID: 91.1.2 [Bytes transmitted]
    Data Type: 64-bit int  InDom: 91.1 0x16c00001
    Semantics: counter  Units: byte
Help:
Counter of data octets, transmitted on all VLs from the port. This 
includes all octets between (and not including) the start of 
packet delimiter and the VCRC, and may include packets containing errors.
It excludes all link packets. 

This counter is implemented by sampling underlying saturating PortXmtData 
counter. When a value of saturated counter reaches predefined threshold,
the counter is reset after its value is copied into internal state.
