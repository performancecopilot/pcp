dbpmda> help attr

attr name [value]
attr attr# [value]

Set a security attribute. These set aspects of per-user authentication,
allowing a PMDA to provide different metric views for different users.

dbpmda> help children

children metric-name

Fetch and print the next name component of the direct decendents of
metric-name in the PMNS, reporting for each if it is a leaf node or a
non-leaf node.
Most useful for PMDAs that support dynamic metrics in the PMNS.

dbpmda> help close

close

Close the pipe to a daemon PMDA or dlclose(3) a DSO PMDA. dbpmda does not
exit, allowing another PMDA to be opened.

dbpmda> help debug

debug all | none
debug flag [ flag ... ] (flag is decimal or symbolic name)

Specify which debugging flags should be active (see pmdbg(1)).  Flags may
be specified as integers or by name, with multiple flags separated by
white space.  All flags may be selected or deselected if 'all' or 'none' is
specified.  The current setting is displayed by the status command.


dbpmda> help desc

desc metric

Print out the meta data description for the 'metric'.  The metric may be
specified by name, or as a PMID of the form N, N.N or N.N.N.

dbpmda> help fetch

fetch metric [ metric ... ]

Fetch metrics from the PMDA.  The metrics may be specified as a list of
metric names, or PMIDs of the form N, N.N or N.N.N.

dbpmda> help getdesc

getdesc on | off

Before doing a fetch, get the descriptor so that the result of a fetch
can be printed out correctly.

dbpmda> help instance

instance indom# [ number | name | "name" ]

List the instances in 'indom'.  The list may be restricted to a specific
instance 'name' or 'number'.

dbpmda> help name

name pmid#

Print the name of the metric with PMID pmid#.  The pmid# syntax follows
the source PMNS syntax, namely 3 numbers separated by '.' to encode
the domain, cluster and item components of the PMID, e.g.
    name 29.0.1004
Most useful for PMDAs that support dynamic metrics in the PMNS.

dbpmda> help namespace

namespace fname

Unload the current Name Space and load up the given Name Space.
If unsuccessful then will try to reload the previous Name Space.

dbpmda> help open

open dso dsoname init_routine [ domain# ]
open pipe execname [ arg ... ]
open socket unix sockname
open socket inet port#|service
open socket ipv6 port#|service

Open a PMDA as either a DSO, via a network socket (unix/inet/ipv6), or as a
daemon (connected with a pipe).  The 'dsoname' and 'execname' fields are
the path to the PMDA shared object file or executable.  The first socket PMDA
field is the type - either unix (if supported), inet or ipv6.  The 'sockname'
argument for unix sockets is a path of a named pipe where a PMDA is listening
for connections.  The 'port' argument is a port number, 'serv' a service name
typically defined in /etc/services (resolved to a port via getservent(3)).
The arguments to this command are similar to a line in the pmcd.conf file.

dbpmda> help pmid

pmid metric-name

Print the PMID for the named metric
Most useful for PMDAs that support dynamic metrics in the PMNS.

dbpmda> help profile

profile indom# [ all | none ]
profile indom# [ add | delete ] number

For the instance domain specified, the profile may be changed to include
'all' instances, no instances, add an instance or delete an instance.

dbpmda> help quit

quit

Exit dbpmda.  This also closes any open PMDAs.

dbpmda> help status

status

Display the state of dbpmda, including which PMDA is connected, which
pmDebug flags are set, and the current profile.

dbpmda> help store

store metric "value"

Store the value (int, real or string) into the 'metric'.  The metric may be
specified by name or as a PMID with the format N, N.N, N.N.N.  The value to
be stored must be enclosed in quotes.  Unlike the other commands, a store
must request a metric description and fetch the metric to determine how to
interpret the value, and to allocate the PDU for transmitting the value,
respectively.  The current profile will be used.

dbpmda> help text

text metric
text indom indom#

Retrieve the help text for the 'metric' or 'indom' from the PMDA.  The one
line message is shown between '[' and ']' with the long message on the next
line.  To get the help text for an instance domain requires the word
``indom'' before the indom number

dbpmda> help timer

timer on | off

Report the response time of the PMDA when sending and receiving PDUs.

dbpmda> help traverse

traverse metric-name

Fetch and print all of the decendent metric names below metric-name
in the PMNS.
Most useful for PMDAs that support dynamic metrics in the PMNS.

dbpmda> help wait

wait seconds

Sleep for this number of seconds

dbpmda> help watch

watch logfilename

An xterm window is opened which tails the specified log file.  This window
must be closed by the user when no longer required.
