sampledso.control
Help:
This control variable may be modified using pmStore().
The allowed values are
    0	disable debugging output in the PMDA
    >0	set pmDebug to this value to enable debugging output
    -1	force the PMDA to terminate

sampledso.daemon_pid

by time(2).

sampledso.milliseconds
Help:
The elapsed time since the PMDA started, in milliseconds, i.e. as
returned by gettimeofday(2), and then adjusted from microseconds
to milliseconds.

sampledso.load
Help:
The hypothetical load is always 42!

sampledso.colour
Help:
This metric has 3 instances, designated "red", "green" and "blue".

The value of the metric is monotonic increasing in the range N to
N+100, then back to N.  The different instances have different N
values, namely 100 (red), 200 (green) and 300 (blue).

The underlying counter starts at 0 and is incremented once
for each pmFetch() to this metric and/or sampledso.mirage and/or
sampledso.mirage_longlong.

Use pmStore() to modify the underlying counter (independent of which
instance or instances are used).

sampledso.darkness
Help:
Defined over the same instance domain as sampledso.colour, but this
metric returns the "No values available" error for every fetch.

sampledso.bin
Help:
9 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with a constant
value of 100 thru 900.

sampledso.bucket
Help:
9 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with a constant
value of 100 thru 900.  This is an alias for sampledso.bin, but with
a different PMID.

sampledso.part_bin
Help:
5 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with a constant
value of 100 thru 900.  This is defined over the same domain as
sampledso.part, but half of the instances are missing.

sampledso.bogus_bin
Help:
9 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with a constant
value of 100 thru 900.  This is defined over the same domain as
sampledso.part, half the values are for instances not in the instance
domain.

sampledso.drift
Help:
This metric returns a random value (expected mean is approximately 200),
subject to a trending pattern such that the sequence is mainly monotonic,
with a change in direction after on average 4 consecutive sampledsos.

Use pmStore() to modify the instantaneous value, which becomes the new
expected mean.

sampledso.step
Help:
This metric changes magnitude every 30 seconds, between a base value and
3 times the base value.

The metric has "instantaneous" semantics.  See also sampledso.step_counter.

Use pmStore() to modify the base value.

sampledso.step_counter
Help:
This metric changes magnitude every 30 seconds, between a base value and
3 times the base value.

The metric has "counter" semantics.  See also sampledso.step.

Use pmStore() to modify the base value.

sampledso.mirage
Help:
The metric is a rate (Kbytes/sec) that varies in a saw-tooth distribution
over time.  Different instances of the metric have different baselines
for the saw-tooth, but all have an max-to-min range of 100.

What makes this metric interesting is that instances come and go (not
more often than once every 10 seconds however).  Instance 0 is always
present, but the other instances 1 thru 49 come and go in a cyclic
pattern with a large random component influencing when each instance
appears and disappears.

The underlying counter starts at 0 and is incremented once
for each pmFetch() to this metric and/or sampledso.colour and/or
sampledso.mirage_longlong.

Use pmStore() to modify the underlying counter (independent of which
instance or instances are used).

sampledso.mirage_longlong
Help:
The metric is a rate (bytes/msec) that varies in a saw-tooth distribution
over time.  Different instances of the metric have different baselines
for the saw-tooth, but all have an max-to-min range of 100,000,000.

What makes this metric interesting is that instances come and go (not more
often than once every 10 seconds however).  Instance 0 is always present,
but the other instances 1 thru 49 come and go in a cyclic pattern with
a large random component influencing when each instance appears and
disappears.

The underlying counter starts at 0 and is incremented once for each
pmFetch() to this metric and/or sampledso.mirage and/or sample.colour.

Use pmStore() to modify the underlying counter (independent of which
instance or instances are used).

sampledso.write_me
Help:
This metric has a 32-bit integer value of 2, unless changed via pmStore.
The metric has semantics of rate, and units of events per second.

sampledso.lights
Help:
A singular metric that has a discrete string value, namely "red",
"yellow" or "green".  There is some persistance in the value, so
consecutive fetches are likely to return the same value, however over a
long period of time all values are equally probable.

sampledso.magnitude
Help:
A singular metric that has a discrete integer value, namely 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32 or 64.  There is some persistance in the value, so consecutive
fetches are likely to return the same value, however over a long period
of time all values are equally probable.

sampledso.sysinfo
Help:
This metric has an aggregate value containing the following struct:
    struct {
        int		len;
        struct sysinfo	sysinfo;
    };

The len field contains the size of the structure enclosing it.
The sysinfo field contains various system accounting structures, summed over
all CPUs, as returned by
    sysmp(MP_SAGET, MPSA_SINFO, ...);

See /usr/include/sys/sysinfo.h for the definition of the sysinfo struct.

sampledso.pdu
Help:
Count of PDUs received or transmitted.

Use pmStore() to reset the counter to 0, independent of the value passed
to pmStore().

sampledso.recv_pdu
Help:
Count of PDUs received.

Use pmStore() to reset the counter to 0, independent of the value passed
to pmStore().

sampledso.xmit_pdu
Help:
Count of PDUs transmitted.

Use pmStore() to reset the counter to 0, independent of the value passed
to pmStore().

sampledso.noinst
Help:
For testing, only.  This metric is known, but no value is ever available

sampledso.needprofile
Help:
Simulate behaviour similar to the "proc" PMDA where metrics values are
only available if an explicit instance profile is provided.

sampledso.not_ready
Help:
Store a positive number of seconds as the value of this metric. The
following PDU received will result in the following sequence of events:
  1. return an error PDU with PM_ERR_PMDANOTREADY to pmcd
  2. sleep for the given number of seconds
  3. sends an error PDU with PM_ERR_PMDAREADY to pmcd
If everything went as planned, sampledso.not_ready returns to 0, otherwise it
has a negative error code as value.

sampledso.rapid
Help:
Base counter increments by 8*10^7 per fetch.  Result is 10 x base counter.

sampledso.error_code
Help:
The metrics sampledso.error_code and sample.error_check are used in tandem
as follows:
    if sampledso.error_code is < 0, then any attempt to retrieve
    information about sampledso.error_check will return a
    sampledso.error_code as a PMAPI error from the PMDA.

Use pmstore(1) to change sampledso.error_code.

sampledso.error_check
Help:
The metrics sampledso.error_code and sample.error_check are used in tandem
as follows:
    if sampledso.error_code is < 0, then any attempt to retrieve
    information about sampledso.error_check will return a
    sampledso.error_code as a PMAPI error from the PMDA.

Otherwise sampledso.error_check is a boring metric that always has
the value 0.

sampledso.dodgey.control
Help:
If sampledso.dodgey.control is <= 0, then this is returned as the "numval"

If sampledso.dodgey.control is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), then this many
of the values will be "visible".  The values will be selected in order
from the underlying 5 instances.

If sampledso.dodgey.control is > 5, then at random times (between 1 and
sampledso.dodgey.control fetches of the metric), the number of instances
available is changed according to the following probabilities ...
  0.9 some number of instances in the range 0 to 5, selected at random
      from the underlying 5 instances.

simple.now
Help:
The value reflects the current time of day through a dynamically
reconfigurable instance domain.  On each metric value fetch request,
the agent checks to see whether the configuration file in
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/simple.conf has been modified - if it has then
the file is re-parsed and the instance domain for this metric is again
constructed according to its contents.

This configuration file contains a single line of comma-separated time
tokens from this set:
  "sec"  (seconds after the minute),
  "min"  (minutes after the hour),
  "hour" (hour since midnight).

An example configuration file could be:  sec,min,hour
and in this case the simple.now metric would export values
for the three instances "sec", "min" and "hour" corresponding
respectively to the components seconds, minutes and hours of the
current time of day.

The instance domain reflects each token present in the file, and the
values reflect the time at which the PMDA processes the fetch.
