#
# Maintenance notes.
# As pmlogconf usage grows, the generated pmlogconf files are going
# to become more complicated and more variable across platforms and
# in particular groups will change from not being expanded by default
# to be expanded by default, and new groups will be added.
#
# Where this test _expects_ a control line to be expanded to a group
# of metrics, we use platform/version variants of the *.out files.
#
# But where a control line is expanded on some platforms, but not
# on others, we should just cull the control line from the $tmp.conf
# file and the block of related changes in all the *.out files ...
# as long as some expansion is done, the test remains valid.
#
# Newly added groups should be handled by adding to the $tmp.cull-list
# file below, using the pmlogconf "tag", e.g. networking/nfs2-client, and
# possibly removing the block of related changes in all the *.out files
#
# Newly added metrics within a group we care about should be culled
# in _filter().
