Pre-Requisites
--------------
In order to perform the tests, we'll make some assumptions:

- The `pcp` Python module is installed and accessible.
- The `rocestat` PMDA has been installed successfully.
- The system has RoCE devices available and the required kernel modules (`ib_core`) are loaded.
- You are able to run the test as the root user (required for PMDA installation and removal).

What the Test Does
------------------
The test validates the functionality of the `rocestat` PMDA by performing the following steps:

1. Installs the `rocestat` PMDA.
2. Fetches metrics defined in `metrics.list` and validates their values against the expected values in `rocestat.json`.
3. Runs unit tests for each metric cluster (e.g., `hw`, `hw_xmit`, `hw_rcv`) to ensure the PMDA is reporting correct values.
4. Removes the `rocestat` PMDA after the tests are complete.

If any of the above checks fail, an exception will be raised, and the test will terminate.

How to Test
-----------
1. Make sure the pre-requisites are in place.
2. Run the rocestat_test.python script
