# PCP QA Test No. 622
# Test for the ability for pmie(1) to accept hyphens in host names, but
# not metric names.
#
# This is in response to test 503, which did not allow for the fact that
# a hostname may have a hyphen in it!  By the way, test 503 should be
# fixed (by now) to allow for hosts with hyphens in their names... this
# test shows how the config file ought to have been built.
