# Note:
#   This used to log just hinv.ncpu, but as of late 2019 I started seeing
#   this test hanging and the QA runs never finished across a number of
#   machines in the QA Farm.  The problem is the remote pmcd (usually, but
#   not always, vm01 for me), where the pmDesc for hinv.ncpu was unavailable
#   because there was no PMCD agent for the domain ... this means the linux
#   PMDA was dead, but pmcd was alive.
#   Added sample.seconds in the hope that this will avoid the problem for
#   this test ... leaving the linux PMDA issue to be investigated separately.
