#
# PCP QA Test No. 162
# namespace only Install/Remove for pmdas
#
# this is less important for PCP 2.0 than it was for PCP 1.x, but we
# need to make sure the functionality still works, e.g. upgrade a
# collector to PCP 2.0, but want to monitor from a PCP 1.x system
#
# Note: expect some "Cannot create" errors from the installation
#	of the pmchart view(s) ... we do not run Install/Remove as root
#	in this test
#
# See also 600.  This version is for the PMDAs in pcp_opensrc.
