PDU specification files for various issue reproducers ...

Two classes of files:

1. ascii data
   Typically used with as
	../src/pdu-gadget <file | netcat
   (to produce binary PDU data) for pmcd testing (see ../common/pmcd-pdu), or
	../src/pdu-gadget -x <file
   for direct testing against the __pmDecode<foo>() routines in libpcp.

2. binary data (from SUSE reproducers)
   Typically used with as
	netcat <file
   for pmcd testing (see ../common/pmcd-pdu)
