# Tests that might fail, but where further investigation is not warranted,
# e.g. known bug, fix is difficult and pending, or sometimes timing issues
# on particular platforms.
#
# Fields are
# - <seqno>
# - <whatami-RE>
# - <comments>
#
# If test <seqno> fails, but there is an entry in this file for that
# <seqno> and the <whatami-RE> field (a grep(1) regular expression)
# matches the output from admin/whatami, then the test is considered
# "Triaged" not "Failed".
#
# The fields here are <tab> separated to allow a space in the
# second field in particular.
#
# Any line that does not begin with a <seqno> followed by a <tab> is
# treated as a comment.  So lines that begin with a # are comments, as
# are lines that begin with white space (the latter is useful to wrap long
# <comments> fields over multiple lines).
#
# Because the <whatami-RE> field is used with egrep, one needs to
# (backslash) escape both [ and ( when a literal match is needed ... (none
# of the other special grep -E RE characters appear in the whatami output).
#
# Typical whatami output looks like:
# bozo                6.0.0    x86_64  Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) [kernel=5.4.0 py=3.8.10 se=none]
# <hostname>          <PCP version>
#                              <hardware>
#                                      <operating system>
#                                                           <key software versions>

135	bozo-vm	sometimes this VM (VMware on Windows) goes to sleep and
		the pmlogger fetches are long-delayed causing the test
		to fail miserably
878	.*	on some QA hosts this fails sometimes when we don't see
		the first or second event record ... despite extensive
		triage the problem is not understood
1210	vm[0-9][0-9]	may collide with pmlogger_check and (correctly)
			detects presence of /etc/pcp/pmlogger/lock
