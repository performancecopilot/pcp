# Tests that might fail, but where further investigation is not warranted,
# e.g. known bug, fix is difficult and pending, or sometimes timing issues
# on particular platforms.
#
# Fields are
# - <seqno>
# - <whatami-RE>
# - <comments>
#
# If test <seqno> fails, but there is an entry in this file for that
# <seqno> and the <whatami-RE> field (a grep(1) regular expression)
# matches the output from admin/whatami, then the test is considered
# "Triaged" not "Failed".
#
# The fields here are <tab> separated to allow a space in the
# second field in particular.
#
# Any line that does not begin with a <seqno> followed by a <tab> is
# treated as a comment.  So lines that begin with a # are comments, as
# are lines that begin with white space (the latter is useful to wrap long
# <comments> fields over multiple lines).
#
# Because the <whatami-RE> field is used with egrep, one needs to
# (backslash) escape both [ and ( when a literal match is needed ... (none
# of the other special grep -E RE characters appear in the whatami output).
#
# Typical whatami output looks like:
# bozo                6.0.0    x86_64  Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) [kernel=5.4.0 py=3.8.10 se=none]
# <hostname>          <PCP version>
#                              <hardware>
#                                      <operating system>
#                                                           <key software versions>

135	bozo-vm	sometimes this VM (VMware on Windows) goes to sleep and
		the pmlogger fetches are long-delayed causing the test
		to fail miserably
749	CentOS Stream9	systemtap-devel is busted here, staprun is missing
878	.*	on some QA hosts this fails sometimes when we don't see
		the first or second event record ... despite extensive
		triage the problem is not understood
1080	Ubuntu 2[02]\.	for pcp-atop built -O2 (not -O0) valgrind reports
			Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value
			at 0x11F1D2: deviattask (deviate.c:340)
			but this seems bogus and is not seen elsewhere
1210	vm[0-9][0-9]	may collide with pmlogger_check and (correctly)
			detects presence of /etc/pcp/pmlogger/lock
1290	Debian 1[01]	valgrind-reported issues in libpcp_web redis i/o functions
1339	OpenBSD 7\.	there is some race condition between pmcd and the sample
			PMDA when using inet sockects to communicate ... the
			test passes sometimes and fails other times and hand
			testing with dbpmda cannot reproduce a failure
1574	.*	valgrind-reported issue in libpcp_web pmseries functions
1662	.*	valgrind-reported issue in libpcp_web archive discovery
		handling of sources
1973	Ubuntu 16\.04	Python here is 3.5.2 and there a bunch of what look like
			dict ordering and/or cacheing sequence differences
			and some arithmetic rounding differences ... not
			worth wasting more time on
1988	Ubuntu 16\.04	Python here is 3.5.2 and there a bunch of what look
			arithmetic rounding differences ... not worth wasting
			more time on
1989	Ubuntu 16\.04	Python here is 3.5.2 and the output is not even
			close to the expected output with different timestamps
			and order of stats being reported ... not worth
			wasting more time on
1990	Ubuntu 16\.04	Python here is 3.5.2 and the output is not even

1991	Ubuntu 16\.04	Python here is 3.5.2 and there are a couple of

			wasting more time on
