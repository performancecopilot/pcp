# PCP QA Test No. 142
# memory leaks from pmlogreduce
#
# Note on number of samples in the output ... due to slight timestamp
# variations, for some of the output sample intervals there are _no_
# input records ... earlier pmlogreduce versions incorrectly generated
# mark records in this case, but there should simply be no output record
# for 46 of the 745 samples for this particular input archive and command
# line arguments to pmlogreduce
