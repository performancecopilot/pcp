Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) provides a framework and services to support
system-level performance monitoring and management. It presents a unifying
abstraction for all of the performance data in a system, and many tools
for interrogating, retrieving and processing that data.

PCP is a feature-rich, mature, extensible, cross-platform toolkit
supporting both live and retrospective analysis. The distributed PCP
architecture makes it especially useful for those seeking centralized
monitoring of distributed processing.

See the INSTALL file for build, installation and configuration steps.
