Subject: Use portable ar fallback in configure script

The configure script has a hardcoded fallback to /usr/bin/ar which doesn't
exist on NixOS and other non-FHS systems. Change the fallback to just "ar"
which will be found via PATH.

This is a more portable default that works on any system where ar is in PATH.
For Nix builds, AR is explicitly set in preConfigure for reproducibility,
so this fallback only affects non-Nix builds.
