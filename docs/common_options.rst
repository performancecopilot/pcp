-h, --help
    Print short help message (similar to **bpftool help**).

-V, --version
    Print bpftool's version number (similar to **bpftool version**), the number
    of the libbpf version in use, and optional features that were included when
    bpftool was compiled. Optional features include linking against LLVM or
    libbfd to provide the disassembler for JIT-ted programs (**bpftool prog
    dump jited**) and usage of BPF skeletons (some features like **bpftool prog
    profile** or showing pids associated to BPF objects may rely on it).

-j, --json
    Generate JSON output. For commands that cannot produce JSON, this option
    has no effect.

-p, --pretty
    Generate human-readable JSON output. Implies **-j**.

-d, --debug
    Print all logs available, even debug-level information. This includes logs
    from libbpf as well as from the verifier, when attempting to load programs.
