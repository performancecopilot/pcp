    ## ABOUT PMWEBAPI
    The PMWEBAPI (Performance Metrics Web Application Programming Interface) is a collection of interfaces providing Performance Co-Pilot services for web applications. It consists of APIs for web applications querying and analysing both live and historical performance data, as well as APIs used by web servers.

    The usual HTTP URL-encoded optional parameter rules apply and PMWEBAPI REST requests always follow the convention:
    ```bash
    /api/endpoint?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2
    ```
    Examples in all following sections use the [curl](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/curl.1.html)(1) command line utility with a local [pmproxy](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmproxy.1.html)(1) server listening on port 44322 (default port). The [pmjson](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmjson.1.html)(1) utility is used to neatly format any JSON output, as opposed to the compact (minimal whitespace) form provided by default. The examples in the scalable time series section use historical data recorded by the [pmlogger](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmlogger.1.html)(1) service, in conjunction with a local [redis-server](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/redis-server.1.html)(1).

    Exporting of live performance metrics in an Open Metrics compatible format (as described at https://openmetrics.io and popularized by the https://prometheus.io project) is available.

    The fast, scalable time series query capabilities provided by the [pmseries](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmseries.1.html)(1) command are also available through a REST API. These queries provide access to performance data (metric metadata and values) from multiple hosts simultaneously, and in a fashion suited to efficient retrieval by any number of web applications.

    All requests in this group can be accompanied by an optional *client* parameter. The value passed in the request will be sent back in the response - all responses will be in JSON object form in this case, with top level "client" and "result" fields.
- name: FULL TEXT SEARCH
  description: |
    The full text search capabilities provided by the [pmsearch](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmsearch.1.html)(1) command are also available through a REST API. These queries provide access to an index over performance metric names, instances, instance domains and help text, suitable for a metric search engine, and in a fashion suited to efficient querying by any number of web applications.

    In order to use this functionality, the optional *RediSearch* module must be loaded in the **redis-server** at the time **pmproxy** is started, such that metrics, instances and help text it discovers can be automatically indexed.
- name: PMAPI HOST SERVICES
  description: |
    The live performance collection facilities available from [pmcd](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmcd.1.html)(1) can also be accessed through a REST API.

    All requests are performed on the web server host by default, unless either a *hostspec* or *context* parameter is provided. *hostname* can be used in place of *hostspec*.

    Context identifiers are used as a persistent way to refer to PMAPI contexts across related web requests. These contexts expire after a configurable period of disuse, and are either explicitly allocated using the */pmapi/context* interface, or implicitly allocated using other interfaces.

    The timeout interval is configurable at context creation time, and as such the *polltimeout* parameter can be used anywhere the *hostspec* is specified. It sets the context timeout in terms of length of inactive time. The unit for the timeout value is seconds and the default is 5.

    To specify a specific existing context in any PMAPI web request, the endpoints can be accessed with either the *context* parameter or embedded in the endpoint URL itself, such as **/pmapi/[number]/fetch**.
- name: NOTES
  description: |
    For the REST APIs, errors generally result in HTTP-level error responses. Wherever possible, any PMAPI error string will also be provided in a message along 
    with the response.
    
    All responses will be returned using HTTP 1.1 protocol and with chunked encoding being used to stream responses that are larger than a configured maximum size. 
    Compression will be used on responses whenever the client indicates appropriate support.
    
    An *Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \** header is added to all REST API responses.

      summary: Fetches current values and metadata 
      description: |
        `Get Metrics` fetches current values and metadata for all metrics, or only metrics indicated by a comma-separated list of *names*.
        
        For all numeric metrics with the given NAME prefixes, create an Open Metrics (Prometheus) text export format giving their current value and related metadata.
        
        The response has plain text type rather than JSON commonly used elsewhere in the REST API. This format can be injested by many open source monitoring tools, 
        including Prometheus and [pmdaopenmetrics](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmdaopenmetrics.1.html)(1).
        
        The native PCP metric metadata (metric name, type, indom, semantics and units) is first output for each metric with **\# PCP** prefix. The metadata reported 
        is of the form described on [pmTypeStr](https://pcp.io/man/man3/pmtypestr.3.html)(3), [pmInDomStr](https://pcp.io/man/man3/pmindomstr.3.html)(3), 
        [pmSemStr](https://pcp.io/man/man3/pmsemstr.3.html)(3) and [pmUnitsStr](https://pcp.io/man/man3/pmunitsstr.3.html)(3) respectively. If the [pmUnitsStr](https://pcp.io/man/man3/pmunitsstr.3.html)(3) 
        units string is empty, then **none** is output. The units metadata string may contain spaces and extends to the end of the line.
        
        PCP metric names are mapped so that the **.** separators are exchanged with **_** (':' in back-compatibility mode, where "# PCP" is the identifying line suffix). 
        Both metric labels and instances are represented as Prometheus labels, with external instance names being quoted and the flattened PCP metric hierarchy being 
        presented with each value.

        ```bash
          $ curl -s http://localhost:44322/metrics?names=proc.nprocs,kernel.pernode.cpu.intr,filesys.blocksize

        When querying for time series matches only, no time window options are specified and matching series identifiers are returned in a JSON array.
        ```bash
        $ curl -s 'http://localhost:44322/series/query?expr=disk.dev.read*' | pmjson
        ```
        When querying for time series values as well, a time window must be specified as part of the query string. The simplest form is to just request the most recent sample.
        ```bash
        $ curl -s 'http://localhost:44322/series/query?expr=disk.dev.read*[samples:1]' | pmjson

        This command operates in one of three modes.

        It can perform a label set lookup for one or more time series identifiers, when given the series parameter. The JSON response for this mode contains the same information as the **pmseries - I /-- labels** option.
        ```bash

        ```
        It can produce a list of all known label names, in the absence of name , names or series parameters. The JSON responses for this mode contains the same information as the **pmseries - l /-- labels** option.        
        ```bash
        $ curl -s http://localhost:44322/series/labels | pmjson
        ```
        It can produce a list of all known label values for a given label name or names . The JSON response for this mode contains the same information as the **pmseries - v /-- values** option.

        The mandatory search string is further described in [pmsearch](https://pcp.io/man/man1/pmsearch.1.html)(1) and is passed to the server via the *query* parameter (HTTP GET).
        ```bash

        ```
        The available search entity *types* are *metric*, *indom* and *instance*. Query parameters *highlight* and *field* take *name*, *oneline* and *helptext*.

        Query parameter *return* takes *name*, *type*, *oneline*, *helptext*, *indom*. There is typically both a name and help text associated with metrics. Contents of these are then matched 
        against *query*. An instance domain has help text and a numeric identifier, while instances have a name only (which can be searched).

      summary: Creates a context for live sampling
      description: | 
        To create a context for live sampling, a web client can access any */pmapi* URL (optionally using the *hostspec* or *context* parameter). If no 
        context exists, a new one will be created for that web client, and its identifier returned for future accesses.
        
        However, */pmapi/context* is provided as a dedicated URL for applications wishing to explicitly create the contexts they use.
        ```
        $ curl -s http://localhost:44322/pmapi/context?hostspec=www.acme.com&polltimeout=0.5 | pmjson
        ```
        The context (a 32-bit unsigned decimal number) can then be used with all later requests.

        In the case of a *hostspec* containing authentication information, such as a username, the server will follow the HTTP Basic Authentication 
        protocol to ascertain necessary authentication details from the user, providing the client web application an opportunity to request these from 
        the user.

        The *metric* endpoint provides detailed PMAPI metric metadata for one or more metrics. If no parameters are supplied, the response will be for 
        all metrics found when traversing the entire Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS).
        
        The *prefix* parameter can be used to specify a subtree of the PMNS for traversal. Alternatively, a specific metric or comma-separated list of 
        metrics can be specified using either *name* or *names*.
        
        The server response is a JSON document that provides metric metadata as an array.
        ```
        $ curl -s http://localhost:44322/pmapi/metric?names=kernel.all.load,disk.all.read | pmjson

      summary: Fetches (samples) current values for given metrics
      description: | 
        If any of the names or pmids provided are valid, the response is a JSON document that provides the values for all instances of the metrics, unless a instance profile has been 
        set for the web context (see section on InDom profiles below).
        ```

        The response fields map directly to fields from the underlying [pmFetch](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pmFetch.3.html)(3) sampling interface.
        
        Numeric metric types are represented as JSON integer or floating-point values. Strings are passed verbatim, except that non-ASCII values are replaced with a Unicode 0xFFFD 
        replacement character code.
        
        In backward compatibility mode the timestamp is presented as a JSON map with second (sec) and microsecond (us) fields, instead of using the more compact floating point 
        representation shown above.

      summary: Lists the current instances of an instance domain
      description: | 
        This request lists the current instances of an instance domain. The instance domain is either specified directly (in numeric or string form) or 
        indirectly, by association with the specified metric.
        
        The request can be further qualified with a comma-separated list of the instances to report on, either by name or number, using the *instance* and 
        *iname* parameters.
        
        In the case of instance name qualifiers, these will be matched by exact string comparison by default. Alternatively, the match parameter can be used to 
        specify that regular expression or glob pattern matching should be used instead.
        
        The response is a JSON document that provides the instance domain metadata as an array.
