.B pmrep
is a customizable performance metrics reporting tool.
Any available performance metric, live or archived, system and/or application,
can be selected for reporting using one of the output alternatives listed below
together with applicable formatting options.
.P
.B pmrep
collects the selected metric values through the facilities of the
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), see
.BR PCPIntro (1).
The metrics to be reported are specified on the command line, in a
configuration file, or both.
Metrics can be automatically converted and scaled using the PCP facilities,
either by default or by per-metric scaling specifications.
In addition to the existing metrics, derived metrics can be defined using the
arithmetic expressions described in
.BR pmRegisterDerived (3).
.P
Unless directed to another host by the
.B \-h
option,
.B pmrep
will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD, see
.BR pmcd (1))
on the local host.
.P
The
.B \-a
option causes
.B pmrep
to use the specified set of archive logs rather than connecting to a PMCD.
The
.B \-a
and
.B \-h
options are mutually exclusive.
.P
The
.B \-L
option causes
.B pmrep
to use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs (Performance
Metrics Domain Agents, ``plugins'') on the local host without PMCD.
Only some metrics are available in this mode.
The
.BR \-a ,
.BR \-h ,
and
.B \-L
options are mutually exclusive.
.P
The metrics of interest are named in the
.I metricspec
argument(s).
If a metricspec specifies a non-leaf node in the
Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), then
.B pmrep
will recursively descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes (i.e.,
metrics) for that metricspec.
(Use for example
.BR pminfo (1)
to list all the leaf nodes and their descriptions.)
.P
A
.I metricspec
has three different forms. First, on the command line it can start with
a colon (``:'') to indicate a
.I metricset
to be read from a
.B pmrep
configuration file (see
.BR pmrep.conf (5))
which can then consist of any number of metricspecs.
Second, a
.I metricspec
starting with non-colon specifies a PMNS node as described above,
optionally followed by metric formatting definitions (applicable only to
leaf nodes).
This so-called
.I compact form
of a metricspec is defined as follows:
.P
.in 1.5i
.ft CW
.nf
metric[,label[,instance[,unit/scale[,type[,width]]]]]
.fi
.ft R
.in
.P
A valid PMNS node
.RI ( metric )
is mandatory.
It can be followed by a text
.I label
used by supporting output targets (such as
.I csv
and
.IR stdout ,
see below).
The optional
.I instance
definition restricts
.I csv
and
.I stdout
reporting to the specified instances (so non-matching instances
will be filtered).
An optional
.I unit/scale
is applicable for dimension-compatible, non-string metrics.
(See below for supported
.I unit/scale
specifications.)
By default, cumulative counter metrics are converted to rates.
Finally, for supporting output targets (currently:
.IR stdout )
a numeric
.I width
can be used to set the width of the output column for this metric.
Too-wide numeric values for output will not be printed (apart from
trailing decimals, numeric values will never be silently truncated).
Too-wide strings will be truncated.
.P
As a special case with metrics that are counters with time units
(nanoseconds to hours), the
.I unit/scale
can be used to change the default reporting (for example,
milliseconds / second) to normalize to the range zero to one
by setting this to
.B sec
(see also
.BR -y ).
.P
The following
.I metricspec
requests the metric
.B kernel.all.sysfork
to be reported under the label
.BR forks ,
converting to the default rate count/s in an
.B 8
wide column.
Although the definitions in this
.I compact form
are optional, they must always be provided in the order specified above.
.P
.in 1.5i
.ft CW
.nf
kernel.all.sysfork,forks,,,,8
.fi
.ft R
.in
.P
The third form of a metricspec is described and valid only in
.BR pmrep.conf (5).
.P
Derived metrics are specified like PMNS leaf node metrics.
.P
Configuration file options override the corresponding built-in
default values (if any).
Command line options override the
corresponding configuration file options (if any).
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
.B \-a
Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of Performance Co-Pilot
(PCP) archive log files identified by the argument
.IR archive ,
which is a comma-separated list of names, each
of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
one or more archives.
See also
.BR \-u .
.TP
.B \-\-archive\-folio
Read metric source archives from the PCP archive
.IR folio
(see
.BR mkaf (1)).
.TP
.B \-A
Force the initial sample to be
aligned on the boundary of a natural time unit
.IR align .
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of the syntax for
.IR align .
.TP
.B \-b
.I Unit/scale
for space (byte) metrics, possible values include
.BR bytes ,
.BR Kbytes ,
.BR KB ,
.BR Mbytes ,
.BR MB ,
and so forth up to
.BR Ebytes ,
.BR EB .
This option will
.I not
override possible per-metric specifications.
See also
.BR pmParseUnitsStr (3).
.TP
.B \-c
Specify the
.I config
file to use.
The default is the first found of:
.BR ./pmrep.conf ,
.BR $HOME/.pmrep.conf ,
.BR $HOME/pcp/pmrep.conf ,
and
.BR $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmrep/pmrep.conf .
See
.BR pmrep.conf (5).
.TP
.B \-\-container
Fetch performance metrics from the specified
.IR container ,
either local or remote (see
.BR \-h ).
.TP
.B \-C
Exit before reporting any values, but after parsing the configuration
and metrics and printing possible headers.
.TP
.B \-d
When replaying from an archive, this option requests that the prevailing
real-time delay be applied between samples (see
.BR \-t )
to effect a pause, rather than the default behaviour of replaying at
full speed.
.TP
.B \-\-daemonize
Daemonize on startup.
.TP
.B \-e
Specify
.I derived
performance metrics. If
.I derived
starts with a slash (``/'') or with a dot (``.'') it will be
interpreted as a derived metrics configuration file, otherwise it will
be interpreted as comma-separated derived metric expressions.
For details see
.BR pmLoadDerivedConfig (3)
and
.BR pmRegisterDerived (3).
.TP
.B \-E
Repeat the header every
.I lines
of output.
.TP
.B \-f
Use the
.I format
string for formatting the timestamp.
The format will be used with
Python's
.B datetime.strftime
method which is mostly the same as that described in
.BR strftime (3).
An empty
.I format
string (i.e., '') will remove the timestamps from the output.
The default with \fIstdout\fR is
.BR %H:%M:%S .
The default with \fIcsv\fR is
.BR "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" .
.TP
.B \-F
Specify the output file
.IR outfile .
See
.BR \-o .
.TP
.B \-G
Do not include global metrics in reporting (see
.BR pmrep.conf (5)).
.TP
.B \-h
Fetch performance metrics from
.BR pmcd (1)
on
.IR host ,
rather than the default localhost.
.TP
.B \-H
Do not print any headers.
.TP
.B \-i
Report only the listed
.I instances
(if present).
By default all current instances are reported.
This is a global option that is used for all metrics unless a
metric-specific instance definition is provided as part of a
.IR metricspec .
By default metrics without instances are reported as usual, use
.B \-v
to change this.
.RS
.PP
The list may consist of one or more comma-separated instances.
The instance name may be quoted with single (') or double (")
quotes for those cases where the instance name contains commas
or white space. Note that on the command line when specifying
more than one instance, all the names must be quoted.
.PP
Multiple
.B \-i
options are allowed as an alternative way of specifying more than
one instance of interest.
.PP
As an example, the following would report the same instances:
.EX
$ pmrep \-i "'1 minute','5 minute'" kernel.all.load
$ pmrep \-i '"1 minute","5 minute"' kernel.all.load
$ pmrep \-i "'1 minute'" -i "'5 minute'" kernel.all.load
$ pmrep kernel.all.load,,"'1 minute','5 minute'"
$ pmrep kernel.all.load,,'"1 minute","5 minute"'
.EE
.PP
However, this would report only the 1-minute instance:
.EX
$ pmrep \-i '"1 minute","5 minute"' kernel.all.load,,"1 minute"
.EE
.RE
.TP
.B \-I
Ignore incompatible metrics. By default incompatible metrics
(that is, their type is unsupported or they cannot be scaled
as requested) will cause
.B pmrep
to terminate with an error message.
With this option all incompatible metrics are silently omitted
from reporting. This may be especially useful when requesting
non-leaf nodes of the PMNS tree for reporting.
.TP
.B \-k
Write extended CSV output, similar to
.BR sadf (1).
.TP
.B \-K
When fetching metrics from a local context (see
.BR \-L ),
the
.B \-K
option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be made
accessible.
The
.I spec
argument conforms to the syntax described in
.BR __pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).
More than one
.B \-K
option may be used.
.TP
.B \-l
Specify the
.I delimiter
that separates each column of
.I csv
or
.I stdout
output.
The default for
.I stdout
is two spaces (``  '') and comma (``,'') for
.IR csv .
In case of CSV output or stdout output with non-whitespace delimiter,
any string value containing the delimiter will be replaced by the
underscore (``_'').
.TP
.B \-L
Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the local host
without PMCD.
See also
.BR \-K .
.TP
.B \-o
Use
.I output
target for reporting.
The default target is
.IR stdout .
The available target alternatives are:
.RS
.TP 2
.I archive
Record metrics into a PCP archive which can later be replayed with PCP
tools, including
.B pmrep
itself. See
.BR pcp-archive (5)
and
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for details about PCP archive files.
Requires
.BR \-F .
.TP 2
.I csv
Print metrics in CSV format (subject to formatting options).
.TP 2
.I stdout
Print metrics to stdout (format subject to formatting options).
.RE
.TP
.B \-O
When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at
.I origin
within the time window (see
.B \-S
and
.BR \-T ).
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of the syntax for
.IR origin .
.TP
.B \-p
Print timestamps.
By default no timestamps are printed.
.TP
.B \-P
Use
.I precision
for numeric non-integer output values.
If the value is too wide for its column width,
.I precision
is reduced one by one until the value fits, or not printed at all if it
does not.
The default is to use 3 decimal places (when applicable).
.TP
.B \-q
.I Unit/scale
for count metrics, possible values include
.BR "count x 10^-1" ,
.BR "count" ,
.BR "count x 10" ,
.BR "count x 10^2" ,
and so forth from
.B 10^-8
to
.BR 10^7 .
.\" https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264124
(These values are currently space-sensitive.)
This option will
.I not
override possible per-metric specifications.
See also
.BR pmParseUnitsStr (3).
.TP
.B \-r
Output raw metric values, do not convert cumulative counters to rates.
This option \fIwill\fR override possible per-metric specifications.
.TP
.B \-s
The argument
.I samples
defines the number of samples to be retrieved and reported.
If
.I samples
is 0 or
.B \-s
is not specified,
.B pmrep
will sample and report continuously (in real time mode) or until the end
of the set of PCP archives (in archive mode).
See also
.BR \-T .
.TP
.B \-S
When reporting archived metrics, the report will be restricted to those
records logged at or after
.IR starttime .
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of the syntax for
.IR starttime .
.TP
.B \-t
The default update
.I interval
may be set to something other than the default 1 second.
The
.I interval
argument follows the syntax described in
.BR PCPIntro (1),
and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units
in this case are seconds).
See also the
.B \-T
and
.B \-u
options.
.TP
.B \-T
When reporting archived metrics, the report will be restricted to those
records logged before or at
.IR endtime .
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of the syntax for
.IR endtime .
.RS
.PP
When used to define the runtime before \fBpmrep\fR will exit,
if no \fIsamples\fR is given (see \fB-s\fR) then the number of
reported samples depends on \fIinterval\fR (see \fB-t\fR).
If
.I samples
is given then
.I interval
will be adjusted to allow reporting of
.I samples
during runtime.
In case all of
.BR \-T ,
.BR \-s ,
and
.B \-t
are given,
.I endtime
determines the actual time
.B pmrep
will run.
.RE
.TP
.B \-u
When reporting archived metrics, by default values are reported
according to the selected sample interval (\c
.B \-t
option), not according to the actual record interval in an archive.
To this effect PCP interpolates the values to be reported based on the
records in the archive.
With the
.B \-u
option uninterpolated reporting is enabled, every recorded value for the
selected metrics is reported and the requested sample interval (\c
.BR \-t )
is ignored.
.RS
.PP
So for example, if a PCP archive contains recorded values for every 10
seconds and the requested sample interval is 1 hour, by default
.B pmrep
will use an interpolation scheme to compute the values of the requested
metrics from the values recorded in the proximity of these requested
metrics and values for every 1 hour are reported.
With
.B \-u
every record every 10 seconds are used as such (the reported values
are still subject to rate conversion, use
.B \-r
to disable).
.RE
.TP
.B \-U
Omit unit information from of headers.
.TP
.B \-v
Omit single-valued ``flat'' metrics from reporting when instances
were requested.
See
.B -\i
and
.BR -\I .
.TP
.B \-V
Display version number and exit.
.TP
.B \-w
Set the \fIstdout\fR output column
.IR width .
Strings will be truncated to this width.
The default
.I width
is the shortest that can fit the metric label, the forced minimum is 3.
This option will
.I not
override possible per-metric specifications.
.TP
.B \-x
Print extended header.
.TP
.B \-X
Swap columns and rows in \fIstdout\fR output, reporting one instance per
line, using \fIlabel\fR as the label for instance column (set to an empty
string \fB""\fR to enable swapping without a specific label).
This is convenient to allow easily using
.BR grep (1)
to filter results or to more closely mimic other utilities.
See also
.BR -i .
.TP
.B \-y
.I Unit/scale
for time metrics, possible values include
.BR nanosec ,
.BR ns ,
.BR microsec ,
.BR us ,
.BR millisec ,
.BR ms ,
and so forth up to
.BR hour ,
.BR hr .
This option will
.I not
override possible per-metric specifications.
See also
.BR pmParseUnitsStr (3).
.TP
.B \-z
Use the local timezone of the host that is the source of the
performance metrics, as identified by either the
.B \-h
or the
.B \-a
options.
The default is to use the timezone of the local host.
.TP
.B \-Z
Use
.I timezone
for the date and time.
.I Timezone
is in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
Note that when including a timezone string in output, ISO 8601 -style
UTC offsets are used (so something like -Z EST+5 will become UTC-5).
.TP
.B \-?
Display usage message and exit.
