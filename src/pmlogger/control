# PCP archive logging configuration/control
#
# This file is used by various of the PCP archive logging administrative
# tools to perform maintenance on the pmlogger instances running on
# the local host.
#
# This file contains one line per host to be logged, fields are
#    Host	name of host to be logged
#    P(rimary)	is this the primary logger? y or n
#    S(ocks)	should this logger be launched with pmsocks? y or n
#    Directory	full pathname to directory where archives are
#		to be maintained ... note all scripts "cd" to here as
#		a first step
#    Args	optional additional arguments to pmlogger
#
# All files below "${PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH}.d" are appended to this
# file before evaluation, if any exist.

# Uncomment one of the lines below to enable/disable compression behaviour
# that is different to the pmlogger_daily default.
# Value is days before compressing archives, 0 is immediate compression,
# "never" or "forever" suppresses compression.

#$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER=0
#$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER=3
#$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER=never

# if pmsocks is being used, edit the IP address for $SOCKS_SERVER
#$SOCKS_SERVER=123.456.789.123

# Note: - LOCALHOSTNAME will be expanded to local: in the first column,
#         and to `hostname` in the fourth (directory) column
#       - Default local primary logger specification is nowadays setup
#         via ${PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH}.d/local
#	- If multiple pmloggers for the same host (e.g. both primary and
#	  non-primary loggers are active), then they MUST use different
#	  directories
