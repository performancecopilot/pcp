.TH PMDALUSTRE 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdalustre\f1 \- lustre filesystem statistics performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdalustre\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0) which
reads and exports metric values from the statistics interfaces of a Lustre filesystem.
.PP
.B pmdalustre
searches for statistics interfaces from several locations,
which vary depending on the version of
.B Lustre
installed locally.
.PP
Recent
.B Lustre
versions (v2.12 and later) export statistics from the kernel
.B debugfs
pseudo filesystem,
in the directories
.B /sys/kernel/debug/lustre/llite
and
.BR /sys/kernel/debug/lnet .
If these interfaces are not found during startup,
.B pmdalustre
will automatically check if the statistics interfaces are available from the
.B procfs
pseudo filesystem below the
.B /proc/fs/lustre/llite
and
.B /proc/sys/lnet
directories.
These are the default locations of the statistics for
.B Lustre
versions less than
.BR v2.12 .
.PP
If neither of the above filesystem interfaces are detected,
or if the user wants to override the default locations,
.B pmdalustre
also supports an optional configuration file named
.BR $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/lustre.conf .
Note that
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR
is set to
.B /var/lib/pcp/pmdas
on most Linux based  systems.
The configuration file supports
.BR perl (1)
variable assignment syntax.
An example configuration file suitable for
.B Lustre
v2.12 and later is:
.in 2i
.nf

.B $LLITE_PATH="/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/llite/";
.B $LNET_PATH="/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/lnet/";

.fi
.in
See comments in the shipped
.B lustre.conf
file for further details.
By default, this file is installed with everything commented
(and so it has no effect unless edited) because the built-in heuristics used by
.B pmdalustre
should suffice.
.PP
Finally, overriding all of the above, the
.B LUSTRE_LLITE_PATH
and
.B LUSTRE_LNET_PATH
environment variables may be set (and exported) to specify the directory locations
of the statistics interfaces to be used.
This mechanism using environment variables is intended to be used
for development and testing purposes only.
.PP
The
.B pmdalustre
process runs as the root user because
.B debugfs
directories are not normally readable by unprivileged users.
.SH INSTALLATION
Install
.B pmdalustre
by using the
.B Install
script as the root user:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
\fBpmdalustre\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.
.SH FILES
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/Install\fR" 4
installation script for the \fBpmdalustre\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/Remove\fR" 4
undo installation script for the \fBpmdalustre\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lustre.log\fR" 4
default log file for error messages from \fBpmdalustre\fR
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/lustre.conf\fR" 4
Configuration file for over-riding default statistics directories used by \fBpmdalustre\fP.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
