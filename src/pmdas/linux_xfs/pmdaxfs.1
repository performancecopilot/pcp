.TH PMDAXFS 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdaxfs\f1 \- XFS filesystem performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs/pmdaxfs\f1
[\f3\-d\f1 \f2domain\f1]
[\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdaxfs
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
performance metrics describing the state of the XFS filesystem
from the Linux kernel.
.PP
The
.B xfs
PMDA exports metrics that measure information about metadata buffer
usage, the journal, btree operations, inode operations, extended
attributes, directories, quotas, read and write operation counts
and of course throughput.
.PP
The PMDA provides a facility to reset the values of all counters
to zero using
.BR pmstore (1)
with the xfs.control.reset metric.
.PP
A brief description of the
.B pmdaxfs
command line options follows:
.TP 5
.B \-d
It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
.I domain
number specified here is unique and consistent.
That is,
.I domain
should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
.TP
.B \-l
Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
.I xfs.log
is written in the current directory of
.BR pmcd (1)
when
.B pmdaxfs
is started, i.e.
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot
be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
.SH INSTALLATION
The
.B xfs
PMDA is installed and available by default on Linux.
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to establish access to the names, help text and values for the XFS
performance metrics once more, after removal, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
.B pmdaxfs
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.

.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
