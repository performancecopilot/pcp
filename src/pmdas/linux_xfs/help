@ xfs.dir_ops.lookup number of file name directory lookups
This is a count of the number of file name directory lookups in XFS
filesystems. It counts only those lookups which miss in the operating
system's directory name lookup cache and must search the real directory
structure for the name in question.  The count is incremented once for
each level of a pathname search that results in a directory lookup.

@ xfs.dir_ops.create number of directory entry creation operations
This is the number of times a new directory entry was created in XFS
filesystems. Each time that a new file, directory, link, symbolic link,
or special file is created in the directory hierarchy the count is
incremented.

@ xfs.dir_ops.remove number of directory entry remove operations
This is the number of times an existing directory entry was removed in
XFS filesystems. Each time that a file, directory, link, symbolic link,
or special file is removed from the directory hierarchy the count is
incremented.

@ xfs.dir_ops.getdents number of times the getdents operation is performed
This is the number of times the XFS directory getdents operation was
performed. The getdents operation is used by programs to read the
contents of directories in a file system independent fashion.  This
count corresponds exactly to the number of times the getdents(2) system
call was successfully used on an XFS directory.

@ xfs.transactions.sync number of synchronous meta-data transactions performed
This is the number of meta-data transactions which waited to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are slower and more
expensive than asynchronous transactions, because they force the in
memory log buffers to be forced to disk more often and they wait for
the completion of the log buffer writes.

@ xfs.transactions.async number of asynchronous meta-data transactions performed
This is the number of meta-data transactions which did not wait to be
committed to the on-disk log before allowing the process performing the
transaction to continue. These transactions are faster and more
efficient than synchronous transactions, because they commit their data
to the in memory log buffers without forcing those buffers to be
written to disk. This allows multiple asynchronous transactions to be
committed to disk in a single log buffer write. Most transactions used
in XFS file systems are asynchronous.

@ xfs.transactions.empty number of meta-data transactions which committed without changing anything
This is the number of meta-data transactions which did not actually
change anything. These are transactions which were started for some
purpose, but in the end it turned out that no change was necessary.

@ xfs.inode_ops.ig_attempts number of in memory inode lookup operations
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache. Whether the inode was found in the cache or
needed to be read in from the disk is not indicated here, but this can
be computed from the ig_found and ig_missed counts.

@ xfs.inode_ops.ig_found number of successful in memory inode lookup operations
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and found it. The closer this count is to the
ig_attempts count the better the inode cache is performing.

@ xfs.inode_ops.ig_frecycle number of just missed in memory inode lookup operations
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and saw that it was there but was unable to
use the in memory inode because it was being recycled by another
process.

@ xfs.inode_ops.ig_missed number of failed in memory inode lookup operations
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and the inode was not there. The further this
count is from the ig_attempts count the better.

@ xfs.inode_ops.ig_dup number of inode cache insertions that fail because the inode is there
This is the number of times the operating system looked for an XFS
inode in the inode cache and found that it was not there but upon
attempting to add the inode to the cache found that another process had
already inserted it.

@ xfs.inode_ops.ig_reclaims number of in memory inode recycle operations
This is the number of times the operating system recycled an XFS inode
from the inode cache in order to use the memory for that inode for
another purpose. Inodes are recycled in order to keep the inode cache
from growing without bound. If the reclaim rate is high it may be
beneficial to raise the vnode_free_ratio kernel tunable variable to
increase the size of inode cache.

@ xfs.inode_ops.ig_attrchg number of inode attribute change operations
This is the number of times the operating system explicitly changed the
attributes of an XFS inode. For example, this could be to change the
inode's owner, the inode's size, or the inode's timestamps.

@ xfs.log.writes number of buffer writes going to the disk from the log
This variable counts the number of log buffer writes going to the
physical log partitions of all XFS filesystems. Log data traffic is
proportional to the level of meta-data updating. Log buffer writes get
generated when they fill up or external syncs occur.

@ xfs.log.blocks write throughput to the physical XFS log
This variable counts the number of Kbytes of information being written
to the physical log partitions of all XFS filesystems. Log data traffic
is proportional to the level of meta-data updating. The rate with which
log data gets written depends on the size of internal log buffers and
disk write speed. Therefore, filesystems with very high meta-data
updating may need to stripe the log partition or put the log partition
on a separate drive.

@ xfs.log.write_ratio ratio of count of XFS log blocks written to log writes
The ratio of log blocks written to log writes.  If block count isn't a
"reasonable" multiple of writes, then many small log writes are being
performed - this is suboptimal.  Perfection is 64.  Fine-grain control
can be obtained when this metric is used in conjuntion with pmstore(1)
and the xfs.control.reset metric.

@ xfs.log.noiclogs count of failures for immediate get of buffered/internal
This variable keeps track of times when a logged transaction can not
get any log buffer space. When this occurs, all of the internal log
buffers are busy flushing their data to the physical on-disk log.

@ xfs.log.force value from xs_log_force field of struct xfsstats
The number of times the in-core log is forced to disk.  It is
equivalent to the number of successful calls to the function

This is the number of bytes of file data flushed out by the XFS
flushing daemons.

@ xfs.xstrat.quick number of buffers processed by the XFS daemons written to contiguous space on disk
This is the number of buffers flushed out by the XFS flushing daemons
which are written to contiguous space on disk. The buffers handled by
the XFS daemons are delayed allocation buffers, so this count gives an
indication of the success of the XFS daemons in allocating contiguous
disk space for the data being flushed to disk.

@ xfs.xstrat.split number of buffers processed by the XFS daemons written to non-contiguous space on disk
This is the number of buffers flushed out by the XFS flushing daemons
which are written to non-contiguous space on disk. The buffers handled
by the XFS daemons are delayed allocation buffers, so this count gives
an indication of the failure of the XFS daemons in allocating
contiguous disk space for the data being flushed to disk. Large values
in this counter indicate that the file system has become fragmented.

@ xfs.write number of XFS file system write operations
This is the number of write(2) system calls made to files in
XFS file systems.

@ xfs.write_bytes number of bytes written in XFS file system write operations

in XFS file systems. It can be used in conjunction with the write_calls
count to calculate the average size of the write operations to files in
XFS file systems.

@ xfs.read number of XFS file system read operations
This is the number of read(2) system calls made to files in XFS file
systems.

@ xfs.read_bytes number of bytes read in XFS file system read operations

XFS file systems. It can be used in conjunction with the read_calls
count to calculate the average size of the read operations to files in
XFS file systems.
