.TH PMDAPROMETHEUS 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdaprometheus\f1 \- Prometheus PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmdaprometheus\fR is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
creates PCP metrics from Prometheus endpoints, which provide HTTP based
access to application metrics.
.PP
Further details on the Prometheus exposition format can
be found at
.I https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats

.SH SOURCES

As it runs,
.B pmdaprometheus
periodically scans the
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/urls.d
directory, looking for source url files (\c
.IR *.url).
Each .url file contains one complete HTTP or HTTPS URL at which to
pmdaprometheus is to reach a Prometheus endpoint.  The server does not
have to be up or stay running.  The pmda will relay data and metadata
when/if they are up, and will return errors when/if they are down.

.SH METRICS

All metrics from a file named
.IR FOO.url
will be exported as PCP metrics with the
.I prometheus.FOO.
prefix.  Therefore, the FOO name must be a valid component for PMNS metric
names.

\" example
\" describe metric naming conventions
\" refer to pmwebd interop
\" describe # PCP extras

.SH LIMITATIONS

.B pmdaprometheus
and
.B libpcp
internals impose some numerical constraints about the number of sources (4095),
metrics (1024) within each source, and instance domain instances for each
metric (4194304).

.SH INSTALLATION
Install the Prometheus PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdaprometheus\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
