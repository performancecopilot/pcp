.SH NAME
\f3pmdaactivemq\f1 \- ActiveMQ performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdaactivemq\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0) which
exports performance metrics from ActiveMQ.
.SH INSTALLATION
This \s-1PMDA\s0 requires that ActiveMQ has been installed with the Jolokia 
JMX-HTTP bridge enabled. By default the PNDA will connect to localhost at
port 8161 with a username and password of 'admin'. This can be configured
in PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/activemq.conf
.PP
Install the ActiveMQ \s-1PMDA\s0 by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq

.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq

      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdaactivemq\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.
