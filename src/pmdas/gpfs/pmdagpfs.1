.SH NAME
\f3pmdagpfs\f1 \- gpfs filesystem statistics performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdagpfs\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0) which
exports metric values from the
.I /usr/lpp/mmfs/bin/mmpmon
program to provide information on mounted gpfs filesystems.
.SH INSTALLATION

.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
