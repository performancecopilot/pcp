.TH PMDAORACLE 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdaoracle\f1 \- Oracle database PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdaoracle\f1 is a Performance Co-Pilot \s-1PMDA\s0 which extracts
live performance data from a running Oracle database.
.SH INSTALLATION
\f3pmdaoracle\f1 uses a configuration file from (in this order):
.PD 0
.IP "\(bu" 4
/etc/pcpdbi.conf
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fR/oracle/oracle.conf
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&./oracle.conf
.PD
.PP
This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the settings
listed at the start of pmdaoracle.pl, for example:
.PD 0
.IP "\(bu" 4
$username \- username to connect to the database [default: 'SYSTEM']
.IP "\(bu" 4
$password \- password to connect to the database [default: 'manager']
.IP "\(bu" 4
$host \- host the database is running on [default: 'localhost']
.IP "\(bu" 4
$port \- port the database is listening on [default: '1521']
.IP "\(bu" 4
$os_user \-
operating system username (PMDA will run with the corresponding user id) [default: oracle]
.IP "\(bu" 4
@sids \-
an array of $ORACLE_SID database identifiers [default: ('master')]
.PD
.PP
In order to test your local settings, a simple script is provided that
will connect and disconnect from the database \- verifying fundamental
configuration is in place before continuing on.
If the \fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle/connect.pl\f1 script cannot connect,
do not proceed with installation of the PMDA as it will be unsuccessful.
Correct your local settings first.
.PP
Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
oracle performance metrics by doing the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdaoracle\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.
.SH "CONNECTION STATE"
By default,
.B pmdaoracle
will aggressively attempt to maintain persistent connections to Oracle to
ensure timely responses to its queries, and will automatically re-connect
if a connection drops.
.PP
However, in certain circumstances this may be undesirable, so a manual
.BR pmStore (3) 
mechanism is provided to explicitly control disconnecting and reconnecting
to an Oracle instance.
This can be used, for example, to ensure that
.B pmdaoracle
is not connected at shutdown, to ensure a clean Oracle shutdown process.
.PP
The
.B pmstore (1)
command can be used to disconnect and reconnect.
Using the individual instances of the oracle.control.connected
metric, one can set the connection state to either up (1) or down (0).
Additionally,
.BR pminfo (1)
can report on the current status of Oracle connections.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
