.TH PMDADBPING 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdadbping\f1 \- database response time and availability PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdadbping\f1 is a database response time measurement \s-1PMDA\s0.
.PP
\&\fBpmdadbping\fR runs \fBdbprobe\fR\|(1), and exports the performance
measurements it makes available as \s-1PCP\s0 metrics.
.PP
\fBdbprobe\fR\|(1) should be configured to use the type of \s-1DBI\s0
appropriate for the local database, which includes: \s-1RDBMS\s0 flavour,
user/password, delay between "ping" requests, and the \s-1SQL\s0
statement to use.
.SH INSTALLATION
Configure \fBdbprobe\fR\|(1) \- it uses a configuration file from
(in this order):
.IP "\(bu" 4
/etc/pcpdbi.conf
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CR$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fR/dbping/dbprobe.conf
.PP
This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the settings
listed at the start of
.IR dbprobe.pl ,
namely:
.IP "\(bu" 4
database name (see \s-1\fBDBI\s0\fR\|(3) for details)
.IP "\(bu" 4
database user name
.IP "\(bu" 4
database pass word
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1SQL\s0 statement to measure (probe)
.IP "\(bu" 4
delay between probes
.PP
Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
dbping performance metrics by doing the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdadbping\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.
.SH FILES
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/dbprobe.conf\fR" 4
probe configuration file for \fIdbprobe\fR\|(1), used indirectly by \fBpmdadbping\fR
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Install\fR" 4
installation script for the \fBpmdadbping\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Remove\fR" 4
undo installation script for the \fBpmdadbping\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/dbping.log\fR" 4
default log file for error messages from \fBpmdadbping\fR
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
