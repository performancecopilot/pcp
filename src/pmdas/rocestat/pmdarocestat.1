.SH NAME
.B pmdarocestat 
\- Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) for RoCE devices

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B Rocestat PMDA 
(Performance Metrics Domain Agent) is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) module that collects 
and exports performance statistics for RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) devices. It provides insights into 
network performance, error conditions, and congestion events, aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of RoCE-based 
communication.

This PMDA reports software-aggregated InfiniBand port statistics, including received/transmitted bytes and 
packets, link errors, and congestion-related drops, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and failures. 
Additionally, it includes hardware-level counters, which track low-level transmission metrics, duplicate requests, 
NAKs, and physical/constraint errors, offering a deeper view into the underlying transport reliability and efficiency.

Furthermore, Rocestat PMDA collects priority-based lane metrics from ethtool -S <interface>, filtering 
statistics related to priority lanes in RoCE traffic. These metrics provide visibility into traffic distribution 
across lanes, helping diagnose congestion hotspots and optimize workload balancing across different lanes

By integrating Rocestat PMDA into a PCP monitoring environment, users can efficiently analyze RoCE 
network behavior, detect performance anomalies, and optimize high-speed RDMA workloads in data center and HPC 
environments.

.SH INSTALLATION
To install the Rocestat PMDA, follow these steps:
.RS
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rocestat
# ./Install
.fi
.RE

To verify that the PMDA is running:
.RS
.nf
$ pminfo -t rocestat
.fi
.RE

.SH USAGE
To query Rocestat metrics, use the following command:
.RS
.nf
$ pminfo rocestat
.fi
.RE
To retrieve specific metric values:
.RS
.nf
$ pmval rocestat.hw.rcv.port_rcv_packets
.fi
.RE

.SH FILES
.TP
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rocestat/Install
Installation script for Rocestat PMDA.
.TP
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rocestat/Remove
Uninstallation script.
.TP
.I $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/rocestat.log

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and
directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains
the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to specify
an alternative configuration file, as described in pcp.conf(5).
