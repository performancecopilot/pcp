@ SAMPLE.1 Instance domain "colour" for sample PMDA
Universally 3 instances, "red" (0), "green" (1) and "blue" (3).

@ SAMPLE.2 Instance domain "bin" for sample PMDA
Universally 9 instances numbered 100 .. 900 in steps of 100, and named
"bin-100" .. "bin-900"

@ SAMPLE.3 Instance domain "mirage" for sample PMDA
Random number of instances, that change with time.  Instance "m-00" (0)
is always present, while the others are numbered 1 .. 49 and named "m-01"
.. "m-99"

@ SAMPLE.4 Instance domain "family" for sample PMDA.
A fixed set of instances:
    "colleen", "terry", "emma", "cathy" and "fat bald bastard"

@ SAMPLE.5 Instance domain "hordes" for sample PMDA.
A relatively large instance domain, with hundreds of numeric instances.

@ SAMPLE.6 Instance domain "dodgey" for sample PMDA.
Instances for an unreliable instance domain, where the instances can
under certain conditions (random or controlled) return holes, errors,
and other interesting scenarios for testing.  A sample.dodgey.control
metric store controls this instance domain.

@ SAMPLE.7 Instance domain "dynamic" for sample PMDA.
Instances come from $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/dynamic.indom, if it exists.

@ SAMPLE.8 Instance domain "many" for sample PMDA.
A varable size set of instances controlled by sample.many.count

@ SAMPLE.9 Instance domain "scramble" for sample PMDA.
Several constant instances, instances reordered on successive pmFetch
calls, and sometimes (probability 0.33) some instances are missing.

@ SAMPLE.10 Instance domain "events" for sample PMDA.
Instances "fungus" and "bogus" for testing event metrics indoms.

@ SAMPLE.11 Instance domain "ghosts" for sample PMDA.
Instances are the names of some famous ghosts.

@ SAMPLE.12 Instance domain "procs" for sample PMDA
Simulated and small instance domain that mimics the behaviour of the
process instance domain from the proc PMDA.

The first 5 instances are fixed.  Then next 15 instances are variable
such that each time an associated metric is fetched:
- if an instance is currently defined, it may disappear with
  probability 0.075
- for each instance that is not defined, a new instance may
  appear with probability 0.075

The internal instance identifiers mimic PIDs and are monotonically
increasing up to 1000, when they wrap (duplicates are obviously
avoided).

The external instance names are the instance number, space, then
a random "executable" name.

@ sample.control A control variable for the "sample" PMDA
This control variable may be modified using pmStore().
The allowed values are
    0	disable debugging output in the PMDA
    >0	value is interpreted as a vector of bit-fields to set
        old-style debugging options, see pmdbg -o -l for mapping
	from values to debugging options
    -1	force the PMDA to terminate

@ sample.daemon_pid Process id of PMDA daemon
The process id of PMDA daemon, -1 if the daemon is a DSO.

@ sample.seconds Elapsed time (seconds)
The elapsed time since the PMDA started, in seconds, i.e. as returned
by time(2).

@ sample.milliseconds Elapsed time (milliseconds)
The elapsed time since the PMDA started, in milliseconds, i.e. as
returned by gettimeofday(2), and then adjusted from microseconds
to milliseconds.

@ sample.load Hypothetical load
The hypothetical load is always 42!

@ sample.colour Metrics with a "saw-tooth" trend over time
This metric has 3 instances, designated "red", "green" and "blue".

The value of the metric is monotonic increasing in the range N to
N+100, then back to N.  The different instances have different N
values, namely 100 (red), 200 (green) and 300 (blue).

The underlying counter starts at 0 and is incremented once
for each pmFetch() to this metric and/or sample.mirage and/or
sample.mirage_longlong.

Use pmStore() to modify the underlying counter (independent of which
instance or instances are used).

@ sample.darkness No values available
Defined over the same instance domain as sample.colour, but this
metric returns the "No values available" error for every fetch.

@ sample.bin Several constant instances
9 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with an
initial value of 100 thru 900.

pmstore(1) may be used to change the values of some or all of
the instances, but note this will also change the values of the
metrics that share the same underlying values, i.e. sample.bucket,
sample.part_bin, sample.bogus_bin, sample.scramble.bin
sample.long.bin, sample.long.bin_ctr, sample.ulong.bin,
sample.ulong.bin_ctr, sample.longlong.bin, sample.longlong.bin_ctr,
sample.ulonglong.bin, sample.ulonglong.bin_ctr, sample.float.bin,
sample.float.bin_ctr, sample.double.bin, sample.double.bin_ctr
and sample.string.bin.

@ sample.bucket Several constant instances
9 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with a constant
value of 100 thru 900.  This is an alias for sample.bin, but with
a different PMID.

@ sample.part_bin Several constant instances
5 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with a constant
value of 100 thru 900.  This is defined over the same domain as
sample.part, but half of the instances are missing.

@ sample.bogus_bin Several constant instances
9 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with a constant
value of 100 thru 900.  This is defined over the same domain as
sample.part, half the values are for instances not in the instance
domain.

@ sample.drift A random trended metric
This metric returns a random value (expected mean is approximately 200),
subject to a trending pattern such that the sequence is mainly monotonic,
with a change in direction after on average 4 consecutive samples.

Use pmStore() to modify the instantaneous value, which becomes the new
expected mean.

@ sample.step A step function (instantaneous)
This metric changes magnitude every 30 seconds, between a base value and
3 times the base value.

The metric has "instantaneous" semantics.  See also sample.step_counter.

Use pmStore() to modify the base value.

@ sample.step_counter A step function (counter)
This metric changes magnitude every 30 seconds, between a base value and
3 times the base value.

The metric has "counter" semantics.  See also sample.step.

Use pmStore() to modify the base value.

@ sample.needprofile Metrics that need an explicit profile
Simulate behaviour similar to the "proc" PMDA where metrics values are
only available if an explicit instance profile is provided.

@ sample.lights Traffic lights.
A singular metric that has a discrete string value, namely "red",
"yellow" or "green".  There is some persistance in the value, so
consecutive fetches are likely to return the same value, however over a
long period of time all values are equally probable.

@ sample.magnitude Powers of two.
A singular metric that has a discrete integer value, namely 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32 or 64.  There is some persistance in the value, so consecutive
fetches are likely to return the same value, however over a long period
of time all values are equally probable.

@ sample.pdu Total PDU count
Count of PDUs received or transmitted.

Use pmStore() to reset the counter to 0, independent of the value passed
to pmStore().

@ sample.recv_pdu Count of PDUs received
Count of PDUs received.

Use pmStore() to reset the counter to 0, independent of the value passed
to pmStore().

@ sample.xmit_pdu Count of PDUs transmitted
Count of PDUs transmitted.

Use pmStore() to reset the counter to 0, independent of the value passed
to pmStore().

@ sample.mirage Simple saw-tooth rate, but instances come and go
The metric is a rate (Kbytes/sec) that varies in a saw-tooth distribution
over time.  Different instances of the metric have different baselines
for the saw-tooth, but all have an max-to-min range of 100.

What makes this metric interesting is that instances come and go although
not more often than once every 10 seconds by default.  Use pmstore to
change sample.controller.mirage and the frequency of instance domain
changes can be varied.

Instance 0 is always present, but the other instances 1 thru 49 come
and go in a cyclic pattern with a large random component influencing
when each instance appears and disappears.

The underlying counter starts at 0 and is incremented once
for each pmFetch() to this metric and/or sample.colour and/or
sample.mirage_longlong.

Use pmStore() to modify the underlying counter (independent of which
instance or instances are used).

@ sample.mirage_longlong Simple saw-tooth rate, but instances come and go
The metric is a rate (bytes/msec) that varies in a saw-tooth distribution
over time.  Different instances of the metric have different baselines
for the saw-tooth, but all have an max-to-min range of 100,000,000.

What makes this metric interesting is that instances come and go (not more
often than once every 10 seconds however).  Instance 0 is always present,
but the other instances 1 thru 49 come and go in a cyclic pattern with
a large random component influencing when each instance appears and
disappears.

The underlying counter starts at 0 and is incremented once for each
pmFetch() to this metric and/or sample.mirage and/or sample.colour.

Use pmStore() to modify the underlying counter (independent of which
instance or instances are used).

@ sample.write_me Modifiable, but otherwise constant.
This metric has a 32-bit integer value of 2, unless changed via pmStore.
The metric has semantics of rate, and units of events per second.

@ sample.sysinfo Aggregate containing system accounting structures
This metric has an aggregate value containing the following struct:
    struct {
        int		len;
        struct sysinfo	sysinfo;
    };

The len field contains the size of the structure enclosing it.
The sysinfo field contains various system accounting structures, summed over
all CPUs, as returned by
    sysmp(MP_SAGET, MPSA_SINFO, ...);

See /usr/include/sys/sysinfo.h for the definition of the sysinfo struct.

@ sample.dodgey.value 5 unreliable instances
The metric is a set of 5 instantaneous values, drawn at random from the
range 0 to 100.  The number of instances "visible" is controlled by
sample.dodgey.control.

@ sample.dodgey.control control values retured for sample.dodgey.value
If sample.dodgey.control is <= 0, then this is returned as the "numval"
component in the pmResult (0 => no values available, less than 0 =>
various errors).

If sample.dodgey.control is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), then this many
of the values will be "visible".  The values will be selected in order
from the underlying 5 instances.

If sample.dodgey.control is > 5, then at random times (between 1 and
sample.dodgey.control fetches of the metric), the number of instances
available is changed according to the following probabilities ...
  0.9 some number of instances in the range 0 to 5, selected at random
      from the underlying 5 instances.
