Recipe for adding new metrics to the sample PMDA

These notes describe how to add a single metric.  For multiple
metrics, simply repeat each step for each metric.

Changes in ../pmns

    $ cd ..
    $ get_next_pmid
    This will give you the next available PMID for the new metric.

[ ] Edit pmns to add the new metric into the PMNS.
    If you want to check:
    $ PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG= pminfo -m -n root

Changes in ../help

[ ] Edit help to add help text for the new metric and any new instance
    domains.

Changes in ./sample.c

[ ] Add a new entry into desctab[] for the metric.
    Unless they are dynamic PMNS ones, insert the new entry after the
    PMID that is one smaller than PMID of the new metric.

    If the new metric is defined over a new instance domain, say
    FOO_INDOM:

[ ] Add a new entry into indomtab[] ... this typically involves a new
	#define FOO_INDOM ...
    and an initialized pmdaInstid array.

[ ] In init_tables() add another initialization for FOO_INDOM
	indomtab[FOO_INDOM].it_indom = pmInDom_build(dom, serial++);
    and ensure that the associated metric PMID is mentioned in the
    switch below to initialize the indom field of the pmDesc.

[ ] If the metric requires some pre-fetch value or instance domain
    computation, add code at the head of the for-loop based on
    testing the cluster and item fields of the PMID.

[ ] Add code in sample_fetch() in the last (big) switch to return
    the value of the metric

[ ] If the metric supports pmStore(), then add code in
    sample_store():
    - in the intial switch based on the type of the metric
    - in the second switch to perform the action implied by pmStore()

Changes for make

If you add a source file and/or a header, make sure you add the new
file names to $(CFILES) and/or $(HFILES) in BOTH GNUmakefile and
GNUmakefile.install.

Changes for QA

PMNS changes trigger QA fallout, even in tests that are not explicitly
using the new metric.

[ ] These tests include the names or counts of all sample PMDA metrics
    and will need to be remade:
    139 256 273 509 569 662 762 1067

[ ] 1067 may also need some filter love if the values of the metric
    and/or the state of any underlying instance domain is not
    deterministic ... and be careful there is 1067.out.0 and 1067.out.1
    so some diff cut-n-past maybe needed to fix both .out files

[ ] 569 may need some filter love if the values of the metric and/or
    the state of any underlying instance domain is not deterministic

[ ] 156 may need a filter tweak if the total number of values across
    all metrics for the sample PMDA increases beyond a '000 boundary

[ ] Then run check with -g pmda.sample
