@ AMDGPU.0 AMD graphics cards installed in this system

@ amdgpu.numcards Number of Graphics Cards
The number of AMD Graphics cards installed in this system

@ amdgpu.cardname GPU Name
The name of the graphics card

@ amdgpu.cardid GPU card identifier
The internal identifier of the graphics card

@ amdgpu.memory.used Allocated frame buffer memory
Amount of GPU FB memory that has currently been allocated, in bytes.
Note that the driver/GPU always sets aside a small amount of memory
for bookkeeping.

@ amdgpu.memory.total Total frame buffer memory available
The total amount of GPU FB memory available on the card, in bytes.

@ amdgpu.memory.free Unallocated frame buffer memory
Amount of GPU FB memory that is not currently allocated, in bytes.

@ amdgpu.memory.usedaccum Cumulative counter of used memory for each GPU

@ amdgpu.memory.clock The GDDRx memory clock speed in MHz
@ amdgpu.memory.clock_max The maximum GDDRx memory clock speed in MHz

@ amdgpu.gpu.clock The GPU clock speed in MHz
@ amdgpu.gpu.clock_max The maximum GPU clock speed in MHz

@ amdgpu.gpu.temperature The GPU temperature in millidegrees Celsius
The temperature provided is returned in millidegrees celsius, but the
GPU may not have this precision.

@ amdgpu.gpu.load The GPU load, as a percentage

@ amdgpu.gpu.average_power The GPU average power consumption
