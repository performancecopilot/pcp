.TH PMDANETCHECK 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdanetcheck\f1 \- netcheck PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmdanetcheck\fP is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which does basic network checks on the local host by
using simple Python modules and, in some cases, external utilities such
as
.BR ping (1).
.PP
\fBpmdanetcheck\fP loads and acts as a bridge for any number of configured,
separate PCP netcheck PMDA Python modules running Python code
or external programs.
Existing Python modules and programs should be possible to be utilized
with PCP netcheck PMDA modules with minimal effort.
.PP
Note that on SELinux enabled systems for \fBpmdanetcheck\fP to be able to
use the
.BR ping (1)
command the \fBpcp\fP group must be able to create ICMP Echo sockets;
please make sure the group id for \fBpcp\fP is included in the range at
.I /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range
and refer to
.BR icmp (7)
for more details on this.
.SH CONFIGURATION
\fBpmdanetcheck\fP reads a mandatory ini-style configuration file:
.IP
.PD 0
.IP
.I \f(CR$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/netcheck/netcheck.conf
.PD
.PP
This file must contain a \fB[pmda]\fP section.
The following PMDA options are available
(their default values are shown in parenthesis),
options marked with asterisk (\fB*\fP)
can be overridden in module-specific configuration sections:
.TP 15
.B modules \fR(unset)\fP
The \fBpmdanetcheck\fP PMDA reads module-specific configuration for each
module listed in the comma-separated list of \fBmodules\fP (mandatory).
.TP
.B hosts \fR(\fP\fIDGW,DNS\fP\fR)\fP *
A comma-separated list of \fBhosts\fP (optional) specifies the hosts to run
the checks for.
The special values \fBDGW\fP, \fBDNS\fP, \fBNTP\fP will be
translated to the default gateway, nameservers listed in
\fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP, and timeservers listed in
\fB/etc/chrony.conf\fP, respectively, on PMDA startup.
.TP
.B background_check \fR(\fP\fITrue\fP\fR)\fP *
A boolean value for \fBbackground_check\fP (optional) controls whether to run
checks constantly in the background or only on demand.
Refer to the default configuration file for more discussion about this.
.TP
.B check_hosts_parallel \fR(\fP\fITrue\fP\fR)\fP *
\fBcheck_hosts_parallel\fP (optional) controls whether modules should check
hosts one by one or in parallel.
.TP
.B check_interval \fR(\fP\fI1m\fP\fR)\fP *
\fBcheck_interval\fP (optional) specifies the time interval between two
consecutive checks for hosts when checks are done in the background.
Refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of the syntax for the time interval.
.TP
.B align_interval \fR(\fP\fITrue\fP\fR)\fP *
\fBalign_interval\fP (optional) specifies whether to take the previous
check duration into account when pausing between checks.
.TP
.B module_failure_fatal \fR(\fP\fITrue\fP\fR)\fP
A boolean value for \fBmodule_failure_fatal\fP (optional) controls whether
a module failing to initialize should cause the whole PMDA to abort (this
is the default) or to start up with possibly remaining functional modules.
Module configuration errors and internal errors (such as failing to
register the provided PMNS metrics, see \fBpmns\fP(5))
will always cause the PMDA to fail to start.
.PP
For each \fImodule\fP listed in \fBmodules\fP a corresponding \fI[module]\fP
section must be defined.
Each \fI[module]\fP section can contain at least the following options
(their default values are shown in parenthesis):
.TP 15
.B timeout \fR(\fP\fI1\fP\fR)\fP
Force a hard \fBtimeout\fP (optional) for each individual network check
operation.
.TP
.B debug \fR(\fP\fIFalse\fP\fR)\fP
Enable logging of internal \fBdebug\fP messages (rarely used).
.PP
The module-specific options modules accept are described in the default
configuration file.
.PP
Modules expect basic network functionality to be present on the system,
for example the \fBlocalhost\fP address being reachable.
.SH INSTALLATION
To install, the following must be done as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdanetcheck\fP is launched by \fBpmcd\fP(1) and should never be
executed directly.
The \fBInstall\fP and \fBRemove\fP scripts notify \fBpmcd\fP(1) when
the agent is installed or removed.
.PP
In case \fBmodule_failure_fatal\fP is set to \fBFalse\fP, the PMDA
installation will be considered successful if some (but not all)
configured modules fail to load, in such cases metrics provided
by the failing modules will not be available.
The \fBpmdanetcheck\fP agent log file (see below) will contain detailed
information about activation of each module.
.PP
Modules will provide real values only after having collected data.
For example, for the \fBping\fP module the metric value is the
exit value of the \fBping\fP(1) command and for \fBping_latency\fP the
average packet latency as reported by \fBping\fP(1).
For metrics indicating status, \fB0\fP denotes success.
In case a check has not finished yet its metric value is \fB-1\fP.
If a check was terminated during execution due to timeout
the value is \fB-2\fP.
.SH FILES
.TP 5
.I \f(CR$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/netcheck/netcheck.conf
configuration file for the \fBpmdanetcheck\fP agent
.TP
.I \f(CR$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/netcheck/netcheck/*.{py,python}

.TP
.I \f(CR$PCP_LOG_DIR\fP/pmcd/netcheck.log
default log file for messages from the \fBpmdanetcheck\fP agent
.PP
Note that the usual/default value for \fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP is
.B /var/lib/pcp/pmdas
and the default for \fB$PCP_LOG_DIR\fP is
.B /var/log/pcp
but these settings are platform dependent.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
