.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmdaopenmetrics\fR is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
dynamically creates PCP metrics from configured OpenMetrics endpoints,
which provide HTTP based access to application metrics.
The PMDA essentially implements a bridge between
.B Prometheus
and
.BR PCP ,
allowing PCP to easily ingest performance data from more than 650 registered end-points
and many other application specific end-points.
.P
The default \f2config\fP directory is
.BR $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/openmetrics/config.d/ ,
see ``CONFIGURATION SOURCES'' below.
The default URL fetch \f2timeout\fP is \fB2\fP seconds.
The default \f2user\fP, if not specified with the \f3\-u\fP option,
is the current user.
If the
.B \-n
option is given, the list of configuration files will not be sorted prior to processing.
This list is sorted by default but that can be expensive if there are a large number of
configuration files (URLs and/or scripts).
.PP
If the
.B \-D
option is given, additional diagnostic messages will be written to the PMDA log file,
which is
.B $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/openmetrics.log
by default (see also
.BR \-l below).
In addition, the metric
.B openmetrics.control.debug
controls the same debug flag and can be set with the following command:
.br
.in +0.5i
.BI "pmstore openmetrics.control.debug" " value"
.in
.br
where
.I value
is either
.B 1
(to enable verbose log messages)
or
.BR 0
(to disable verbose log messages).
This is particularly useful for examining the http headers passed to each fetch request,
filter settings and other processing details that are logged when the debugging flag is enabled.
.PP
The
.B \-d
option may be used to override the default performance metrics
.I domain
number, which defaults to
.BR 144.
It is strongly recommended not to change this.
The
.I domain
number should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for
.B pmdaopenmetrics
PMDA on all hosts.
See also the
.B \-r
option, which allows the root of the dynamic namespace
to be changed from the default
.BR openmetrics .
.PP
The
.B \-l
option may be used to specify
.I logfile
as the destination for PMDA messages
instead of the default,
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/openmetrics.log .
As a special case,
.I logfile
may be \fB"\-"\fP
to send messages to the
.B stderr
stream instead, e.g.
.BR \-l- .
This would normally be the
.B stderr
stream for the parent process,
.BR pmcd (1),
which may itself have redirected
.BR stderr .
This redirection is normally most useful in a containerized environment, or when using
.BR dbpmda (1).
.PP
The
.B \-r
option allows the root of the dynamic namespace to be changed to
.I root
from the default,
.BR openmetrics .
In conjunction with other command line options,
this allows
.B pmdaopenmetrics
to be deployed as a different PMDA with distinct metrics namespace
and metrics domain on the same host system.
Note that all PMDAs require a unique domain number so the
.B \-d
option must also be specified.
Use of the
.B \-r
option may also change the defaults for some other command line options,
e.g. the default log file name and the default configuration directory.
.SH "CONFIGURATION SOURCES"
As it runs,
.B pmdaopenmetrics
periodically recursively scans the
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/openmetrics/config.d
directory (or the directory specified with the
.B \-c
option), looking for source URL files (\c
.IR *.url )
and executable scripts or binaries.
Any files that do not have the
.B .url
suffix or are not executable, are ignored \- this allows documentation files
such as "README" and non-executable "common" script function definitions to
be present without being considered as config files.
.PP
A remote server does not have to be up or stay running \- the PMDA tolerates
remote URLs that may come and go over time.
The PMDA will relay data and metadata when/if they are available,
and will return errors when/if they are down.
PCP metric IDs, internal and external instance domain identifiers are
persisted and will be restored when individual metric sources become
available and/or when the PMDA is restarted.
In addition, the PMDA checks directory modification times and will rescan
for new or changed configuration files dynamically.
It is
.I not
necessary to restart the PMDA when adding, removing or changing configuration files.
.SH "URL SOURCES"
Each file with the
.I .url
suffix found in the config directory or sub-directory contains
one complete HTTP or HTTPS URL at which
.B pmdaopenmetrics
can reach a OpenMetrics endpoint.
Local file access is also supported with a conventional
.I file:///somepath/somefile
URL, in which case
.I somepath/somefile
should contain openmetrics formatted metric data.
.PP
The first line of a
.I .url
config file should be the URL, as described above.
Subsequent lines, if any, are prefixed with a keyword that can be
used to alter the http GET request.
A keyword must end with
.B ':'
(colon) and the text extends to the end of the line.
Comment lines that start with
.B #
and blank lines are ignored.
The only currently supported keywords are
.B HEADER:
and
.BR FILTER: .
.PP
.B HEADER:
.I "headername\fB:\fP value ... to end of line"
.br
Adds
.I headername
and its value
to the headers passed in the http GET request for the configured URL.
An example configuration file that provides 3 commonly used headers
and an authentication token might be :
.PP
.in 1i
.ft CR
.nf
http://somehost/path/endpoint.html
# this is a comment
HEADER: Accept: text/html
HEADER: Keep-Alive: 300
HEADER: Connection: keep-alive
HEADER: Authorization: token ABCDEF1234567890
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
As mentioned above, header values extend to the end of the line.
They may contain any valid characters, including colons.
Multiple spaces will be collapsed to a single space, and leading
and trailing spaces are trimmed.
A common use for headers is to configure a proxy agent
and the assorted parameters it may require.
.SH "METRIC FILTERING"
Metric filtering is a configuration file feature that allows
ingested metrics to be included or excluded, i.e. filtered.
This is useful because most end-points return multiple metrics,
and usually only some are interesting for monitoring purposes.
The syntax is:
.br
.BI "FILTER: INCLUDE METRIC" " regex"
.br
or
.br
.BI "FILTER: EXCLUDE METRIC" " regex"
.br
Dynamically created metric names that match
.I regex
will be either included or excluded in the name space, as specified.
Note that only the PMNS leaf component of the metric name (as ingested from the URL source)
is compared with the
.I regex
pattern.
The simple rule is that the \fIfirst matching\fP filter regex
for a particular metric leaf name is the rule that prevails.
If no filter regex matches (or there are no filters), then the metric
is included by default, i.e. the default filter if none are specified is
.BR "FILTER: INCLUDE METRIC .*"
This is backward compatible with older versions of the configuration
file that did not support filters.
Multiple
.B FILTER:
lines would normally be used, e.g. to include some metrics but exclude all others, use
.B "FILTER: EXCLUDE METRIC .*"
as the last of several filters that include the desired metrics.
Conversely, to exclude some metrics but include all others, use
.B "FILTER: EXCLUDE METRIC"
.IR regex .
In this case it's not necessary (though doesn't hurt) to specify the final
.B "FILTER: INCLUDE METRIC .*"
because, as stated above, any metric that does not match
any filter regex will be included by default.
.SH "LABEL FILTERING"
Label filtering uses similar
.B FILTER:
syntax and semantics as metric filtering.
.BI "FILTER: EXCLUDE LABEL" " regex"
will delete all labels with label name matching
.I regex
from all metrics defined by the configuration file.
The same rules as for metric filters apply for label filters too - an implicit rule:
.BI "FILTER: INCLUDE LABEL .*"
applies to all labels that do not match any earlier label filter rule.
.BI "FILTER: OPTIONAL LABEL" " regex"
specifies that matching label names are to be included in the
returned metric labelsets (i.e. included), but are
.B not
to be used as part of the the external instance names.
All included labels that are not optional (i.e. the
.I intrinsic
labels) will be concatenated together
and used for external instance naming.
In addition, non-intrinsic labels (i.e. labels tagged as
.BR OPTIONAL )
will have the
.B PM_LABEL_OPTIONAL
flag set in the labelsets returned by
.B notes
callbacks.
This flag affects how the labels are used in certain clients.
For further details, see
.BR pmLookupLabels (3)
and related man pages for further details.
Note that external instance names begin with the unique numeric
internal instance identifier followed by a space, so external instance
names are always unique.
.P
Caution is needed with label filtering because by default, all
labels are used to construct the PCP instance name.
By excluding some labels (or changing them to optional),
the instance names will change.
In addition, excluding all labels for a particular metric changes that
metric to be singular, i.e. have no instance domain.
By excluding some labels, different instances returned by the URL
or scripted configuration entry for the same metric may become duplicates.
When such duplicates occur, the last duplicate instance returned by the end-point
URL or script prevails over any earlier instances.
For these reasons, it is recommended that label filtering rules be configured when the configuration file
is first defined, and not changed thereafter.
If a label filtering change is required, the configuration file should be renamed, which effectively
defines a new metric (or set of peer metrics as returned by the URL or script), with the new (or changed) instance naming.
.P
Unrecognized keywords in configuration files are reported in the PMDA log file but otherwise ignored.
.SH "SCRIPTED SOURCES"
Executable scripts present in the
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/openmetrics/config.d
directory or sub-directories will be executed and the
.B stdout
stream containing openmetrics formatted metric data will be parsed as though it had come from a URL or file.
The
.B stderr
stream from a script will be sent to the PMDA log file, which by default can be found in
.BR $(PCP_LOG_DIR)/pmcd/openmetrics.log .
.PP
Note that scripted sources do not support label or metric filtering (as described above for URL sources) - they can
simply do their own filtering in the script itself with
.BR sed (1),
.BR awk (1),
or whatever tool is desired.
.PP
A simple example of a scripted config entry follows:
.in 1i
.ft CR
.nf

#! /bin/sh
awk '{
    print("# HELP loadavg local load average")
    print("# TYPE loadavg gauge")
    printf("loadavg {interval=\\"1-minute\\"} %.2f\\n", $1)
    printf("loadavg {interval=\\"5-minute\\"} %.2f\\n", $2)
    printf("loadavg {interval=\\"15-minute\\"} %.2f\\n", $3)
}' /proc/loadavg
.in
.fi
.ft 1

This script produces the following OpenMetrics-formatted metric
data when run:
.in 1i
.ft CR
.nf

# HELP loadavg local load average
# TYPE loadavg gauge
loadavg {interval="1-minute"} 0.12
loadavg {interval="5-minute"} 0.27
loadavg {interval="15-minute"} 0.54
.in
.fi
.ft 1

If the above script was saved and made executable in a file named
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/openmetrics/config.d/local/system.sh
then this would result in a new PCP metric named
.B openmetrics.local.system.loadavg
which would have three instances for the current load average values:
.BR 1-minute ,
.B 5-minute
and
.BR 15-minute .
.PP
Scripted config entries may produce more than one PCP leaf metric name.
For example, the above "system.sh" script could also export other metrics
such as CPU statistics, by reading
.I /proc/stat
on the local system.
Such additional metrics would appear as peer metrics in the
same PCP metric subtree.
In the case of CPU counters, the metric type definition should be
.BR counter ,
not
.BR gauge .
For full details of the openmetrics exposition formats, see
.IR https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/blob/master/specification/OpenMetrics.md .
.SH "SELinux CONSIDERATIONS"
Scripted config files are executed by the
.B pmdaopenmetrics
PMDA with the same SELinux context and policy as the local
.BR pmcd (1).
For simple scripts, such as the load average example described above,
this is normally fine.
However AVC errors may result for scripts that make library or system
calls that are restricted by the prevailing SELinux context and policies.
In these cases it is not feasible to unilaterally grant
.B pmcd
or it's PMDAs an unconfined execution policy.
In these site specific cases it will be necessary to create a local
SELinux policy module.
This can be done by capturing the AVC record(s) from the local audit log,
generate a local policy module using
.BR audit2allow ,
and then load the new module using
.BR semodule ,
e.g. as follows :
.in 1i
.ft CR
.nf

    $ sudo grep '^type=AVC.*pcp' /var/log/audit/audit.log \\
    | audit2allow -M mypolicy
    $ sudo semodule -i mypolicy.pp

.in
.fi
.ft 1
If these local policies need to be persistent across reboots,
then a scriptlet similar to the above example may be added to
the local pmcd RC file (typically
.BR /etc/pcp/pmcd/rc.local ).
For further details, see
.BR audit2allow (1)
and
.BR semodule (1).
.SH "METRIC NAMING"
All metrics from a file named
.IR JOB .*
will be exported as PCP metrics with the
.I openmetrics.JOB
metric name prefix.
Therefore, the JOB name must be a valid non-leaf name for PCP PMNS
metric names.
If the
.I JOB
name has multiple dot-separated components, the resulting
PMNS names will include those components and care is needed to ensure
there are no overlapping definitions, e.g. metrics returned by
.B JOB.response
may overlap or conflict with metrics returned by
.BR JOB.response.time .
.PP
Config file entries (URLs or scripts) found in subdirectories of the
config directory will also result in hierarchical metric names.
For example, a config file named
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/openmetrics/config.d/mysource/latency/get.url
will result in metrics being created (by fetching that source URL) below
.BR openmetrics.mysource.latency.get
in the PCP namespace.
Scripts found in subdirectories of the config directory similarly result
in hierarchical PCP metric names.
.SH "DYNAMIC METRIC NAMES"
As described above, changes and new additions can be made to files in
the configuration directory without having to restart the PMDA.
These changes are detected automatically and the PCP metric names below
.B openmetrics
in the PMNS will be updated accordingly, i.e. new metrics will be
dynamically added and/or existing metrics removed.
In addition,
.B pmdaopenmetrics
honors the PMCD_NAMES_CHANGE
.BR pmFetch (3)
protocol that was introduced in PCP version 4.0.
In particular, if
.B openmetrics
metrics are being logged by a PCP version 4.0 or later
.BR pmlogger (1),
new metrics that appear as a result of changes in the PMDA configuration
directory will automatically start to be logged, provided the root of the
.B openmetrics
PMDA namespace is configured for logging in the
.B pmlogger
configuration file.
See
.BR pmlogger (1)
for details.
An example of such a
.B pmlogger
configuration file is :
.in 1i
.ft CR
.nf

log mandatory on 2 second {
	# log all metrics below the root of the openmetrics namespace
	openmetrics
}
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.SH "METADATA"
Metric data returned by URL or scripted configuration files may contain
metadata that can be used by the
.B openmetrics
PMDA to specify the semantics, data type, scaling and units of dynamically created metrics.
This metadata is prefixed with
.B "# PCP5"
or
.B "# PCP"
in the ingested metric data.
For additional information about PCP metadata, see
.BR pmLookupDesc (3)
and
.BR pmParseUnitsStr (3)
and examples in shipped configuration files.
.PP
In-line "PCP5" metadata must be supplied by the metrics source end-point (URL or script).
An alternative is to specify this in the URL configuration file directly, which has the advantage
of not having to modify the source/end-point if the metadata is incorrect or missing.
Metadata specified in the URL configuration file over-rides any in-line metadata.
.PP
The configuration file syntax for specifying metadata is:
.br
\f3METADATA:\fP \f2regex\fP \f2type\fP \f2indom\fP \f2semantics\fP \f2units\fP ... to EOL
.br
Where:
.br
\f3METADATA:\fP is literal
.br
\f2regex\fP is an extended regular expression to match one or more metric names returned by the URL,
.br
\f2type\fP is one of the PCP numeric types (\f332\fP, \f3u32\fP, \f364\fP, \f3u64\fP, \f3float\fP or \f3double\fP),
.br
\f2indom\fP is an arbitrary instance domain name, or \f3PM_INDOM_NULL\fP,
.br
\f2semantics\fP is either \f3counter\fP, \f3instant\fP or \f3discrete\fP and
.br
\f2units\fP is either \f3none\fP or a string extending to end of line that is parsable by
.BR pmParseUnitsStr(3),
i.e. the units, dimensions and scaling to be used for matching metrics.
.PP
An example configuration file that ingests metrics from the Grafana /metrics end-point on localhost,
filters out all metrics returned by that URL
.I except
for
.B grafana_api_response_status_total
and then specifies the metric
.I type
is an unsigned 32 bit integer with a non-singular instance domain named
.B response
and
.B counter
semantics with
.I units
of
.BR count .
.sp
\f3http://localhost:3000/metrics\fP
.br
\f3FILTER: INCLUDE METRIC grafana_api_response_status_total\fP
.br
\f3FILTER: EXCLUDE METRIC .*\fP
.br
\f3METADATA: grafana_api_response_status_total u32 response counter count\fP
.PP
Note that the name in the
.I indom
field is presently ignored unless it is
.BR PM_INDOM_NULL ,
in which case the metric has no instance domain (i.e. singular),
even if it has labels which would otherwise be used for instance naming.
.SH "CONTROL METRICS"
The PMDA maintains special control metrics, as described below.
Apart from
.BR openmetrics.control.debug ,
each of these metrics has one instance for each configured metric source.
All of these metrics have integer values with counter semantics, except
.BR openmetrics.control.status ,
which has a string value.
It is important to note that fetching any of the
.B openmetrics.control
metrics will only update the counters and status values if the corresponding URL is actually fetched.
If the source URL is not fetched, the control metric values do not trigger a refresh and the control
values reported represent the most recent fetch of each corresponding source.
.PP
The instance domain for the
.B openmetrics.control
metrics is adjusted dynamically as new sources are discovered.
If there are no sources configured, the metric names are still defined
but the instance domain will be empty and a fetch will return no values.
.IP \fBopenmetrics.control.status\fP
A string representing the status of the last fetch of the corresponding source.
This will generally be
.B success
for an http response code of 200.
This metric can be used for service availability monitoring - provided, as stated above,
the corresponding source URL is fetched too.
.IP \fBopenmetrics.control.status_code\fP
This metric is similar to
.B openmetrics.control.status
except that it is the integer response code of the last fetch.
A value of
.B 200
usually signifies success and any other value failure.
This metric can also be used for service availability monitoring, with the same caveats as
.BR openmetrics.control.status .
.IP \fBopenmetrics.control.calls\fP
total number of times each configured metric source has been fetched (if it's a URL)
or executed (if it's a script), since the PMDA started.
This metric has counter semantics and would normally be converted to a rate/second by client tools.
.IP \fBopenmetrics.control.fetch_time\fP
Total time in milliseconds that each configured metric source has taken to return a document,
excluding the time to parse the document.
This metric has counter semantics and would normally be rate converted by client tools
but is also useful in raw form as the accumulated parse time since the PMDA was started.
.IP \fBopenmetrics.control.parse_time\fP
Total time in milliseconds that each configured metric source has taken to parse each document,
excluding the time to fetch the document.
This metric has counter semantics and would normally be rate converted by client tools but
is also useful in raw form as the accumulated parse time since the PMDA was started.
.PP
When converted to a rate, the \fBcalls\fP metric represents the average fetch rate of each source
over the sampling interval (time delta between samples).
The \fBfetch_time\fP and \fBparse_time\fP counters, when converted to a rate, represent the
average fetch and parsing latency (respectfully), during the sampling interval.
.PP
The
.BR openmetrics.control.debug
metric has a singular value, defaulting to
.BR 0 .
If a non-zero value is stored into this metric using
.BR pmstore (1),
additional debug messages will be written to the PMDA log file.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.B pmdaopenmetrics
and
.B libpcp
internals impose some numerical constraints about the number of sources (4095),
metrics (1024) within each source, and instances for each metric (4194304).
