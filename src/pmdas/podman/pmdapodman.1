.TH PMDAPODMAN 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdapodman\f1 \- podman container performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman/pmdapodman\f1
[\f3\-d\f1 \f2domain\f1]
[\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR podman (1)
is a utility for managing pods, containers and container
images, following the container pod concept popularized by
Kubernetes.
.B pmdapodman
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
performance metrics describing the state of containers and
pods managed by podman.
.PP
The
.B podman
PMDA exports metrics that measure information about individual
containers and groups of containers, called pods.
.PP
A brief description of the
.B pmdapodman
command line options follows:
.TP 5
.B \-d
It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
.I domain
number specified here is unique and consistent.
That is,
.I domain
should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
.TP
.B \-l
Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
.I podman.log
is written in the current directory of
.BR pmcd (1)
when
.B pmdapodman
is started, i.e.
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot
be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
.SH INSTALLATION
The
.B podman
PMDA is installed and available by default on Linux.
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to establish access to the names, help text and values for the podman
performance metrics once more, after removal, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
.B pmdapodman
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.
