.TH PMDASOCKETS 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdasockets\f1 \- sockets statistics PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdasockets
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
metric values for current sockets on the local system.
.PP
This PMDA currently collects its data through the
.BR ss (8)
utility and requires that the program is installed in order to function.
This dependency may change in the future.
.SH INSTALLATION
To install (enable) the
.B sockets
PMDA, do the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sockets
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
To uninstall (disable), do the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sockets
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdasockets\fR is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.
.SH FILTER CONFIGURATION
The string valued metric
.B network.persocket.filter
specifies the
.BR ss (1)
filter to be applied to optionally select socket states,
IP addresses and other options that
.B pmdasockets
will collect (to populate it's instance domain).
This is loaded on PMDA startup from the file
.B $(PCP_SYSCONF_DIR)/sockets/filter.conf
(typically
.BR /etc/pcp/sockets/filter.conf )
and defaults to
.B state connected
meaning only sockets in the
.B connected
state will be included.
This can be changed persistently by editing
.BR filter.conf
as the root user.
The filter can also be changed dynamically after the PMDA has started by using
.BR pmstore (1)
to store a new filter string in the
.B network.persocket.filter
metric.
E.g.
.in 1i
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# pmstore network.persocket.filter "state all"
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
will change the filter to include sockets in all states.
Note a dynamically stored filter is not persisted across PMDA restarts or reboots
(edit the config file for a persistent change).
For further details of the filter syntax and options, consult
.BR ss (8).
.SH LOGGING CONFIGURATION
The
.BR pmlogconf (1)
configuration file for
.B pmdasockets
is
.BR $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/networking/persocket-linux
(where
.B $PCP_VAR_DIR
is typically
.BR /var/lib/pcp )
which specifies to log all metrics below
.B network.persocket
in the PCP namespace with a default sampling interval of 60 seconds.
The logging interval and metrics to be logged can be changed
by editing that file and then restarting the
.B pmlogger
service.
For details of the syntax, see
.BR pmlogconf (1).
.SH METRICS
The metrics and metadata supported by
.B pmdasockets
correspond to fields reported by
.B ss -noemitauOH
and are also available as help text provided by the PMDA,
e.g. to list all metrics, metadata descriptors and help text:
.in 1i
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# pminfo -fmdtT network.persocket
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
Note that the PMDA must be installed (enabled) for this command to work correctly, see above.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
