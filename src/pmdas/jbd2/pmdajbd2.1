.TH PMDAJBD2 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdajbd2\f1 \- journal block device (JBD) performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/pmdajbd2\f1
[\f3\-d\f1 \f2domain\f1]
[\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1]
[\f3\-j\f1 \f2path\f1]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdajbd2
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
performance metrics from the Journal Block Device subsystem
(version 2) in the Linux kernel.
These metrics are exported by the kernel in procfs files,
one file per block device.
The JBD2 subsystem is used by several filesystems including
ext3, ext4 and ocfs2.
.PP
The
.B jbd2
PMDA exports metrics that measure detailed journal transaction
information, such as time spent waiting and locked, request
rates, blocks used and so on.
.PP
A brief description of the
.B pmdajbd2
command line options follows (these are only relevant when
running the PMDA as a daemon, and not as a shared library):
.TP 5
.B \-d
It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
.I domain
number specified here is unique and consistent.
That is,
.I domain
should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
.TP
.B \-l
Location of the log file.  By default, when running as a daemon
a log file named
.I jbd2.log
is written in the current directory of
when
.B pmdajbd2
is started, i.e.
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot
be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
When running in shared library mode, and diagnostic information will
be written into the
.B pmcd
log file, namely
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log .
.TP
.B \-j
Allows an alternate path to the jbd2 statistics files to be specified.
The default path is
.IR /proc/fs/jbd2 .
.TP
.B \-U
User account under which to run the agent.
The default is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by default.
.SH INSTALLATION
This PMDA is installed by default and in the shared library
mode (rather than as a separate daemon to
.BR pmcd (1)).
Thus, the names, help text and values for the jbd2 performance metrics
should always be available.
.PP
If you do not use these metrics you can remove this PMDA, do the
following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to enable the installation again, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
.B pmdajbd2
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.

.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
