@ dmcache.metadata.total Total metadata blocks
The total number of metadata blocks.

@ dmcache.cache.block_size Block size for cache
The fixed block size of each cache block in bytes.

@ dmcache.cache.used Cache blocks used
The number of cache blocks used.

@ dmcache.cache.total Total cache blocks
The total number of cache blocks.

@ dmcache.read_hits Read bio mapping cache
Number of times a READ bio has been mapped to the cache.

@ dmcache.read_misses Read bio mapping origin
Number of times a READ bio has been mapped to the origin.

@ dmcache.write_hits Write bio mapping cache
Number of times a WRITE bio has been mapped to the cache.

@ dmcache.write_misses Write bio mapping origin
Number of times a WRITE bio has been mapped to the origin.

@ dmcache.demotions Block removed from cache
Number of times a block has been removed from the cache.

@ dmcache.promotions Block moved to cache
Number of times a block has been moved to the cache.

@ dmcache.dirty Blocks different to origin
Number of blocks in the cache that differ from the origin.

@ dmcache.io_mode_code Cache mode
Cache mode code - writeback, writethrough, passthrough.

@ dmthin.pool.size Size of each pool device
The total size of each pool device in Kbytes.

@ dmthin.pool.transaction_id Sync number with volume manager
Number used by userspace to help synchronise with metadata
from volume managers.

@ dmthin.pool.metadata.used Number of metadata blocks used
The number of metadata blocks which are currently in use.

@ dmthin.pool.metadata.total Total number of metadata blocks
The total number of metadata blocks for the given thin storage pool.

@ dmthin.pool.data.used Number of data blocks used
The number of data blocks which are currently in use.

@ dmthin.pool.data.total Total number of data blocks
The total number of data blocks for the given thin storage pool.

@ dmthin.pool.held_root Location of metadata root
The location in blocks of the metadata root that has been 'held' for
userspace read access. "-" indicates that there is no held root.

@ dmthin.pool.discard_passdown Discards passed or not
Whether or not discards are being passed down to the underlying device. 

@ dmthin.pool.read_mode Read mode of the thin pool
Indication of whether the pool is in read/write mode or read only mode.
In the event that the pool encounters certain types of device failures
it will drop into read-only metadata mode. 

@ dmthin.pool.no_space_mode Mode used when pool is out of space
If the pool runs out of data or metadata space, the pool will fallback
to either queuing or error any IO destined to the data device. The
default is to queue until more space is added to the pool. 

@ dmthin.vol.size Size of each thin volume

@ dmthin.vol.num_mapped_sectors Number of sectors mapped
The total number of mapped sectors to the thin volume.

@ dmthin.vol.highest_mapped_sector Highest mapped sector
The highest mapped sector of the thin volume.
