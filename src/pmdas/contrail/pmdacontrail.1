.TH PMDALIO 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdalio\f1 \- Linux LIO subsystem PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdalio\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports 
metric values about the Linux I/O target subsystem, which provides for
protocols like iSCSI, FCP, FCoE.
These allow storage available on one host to be exported and consumed by
other hosts using industry standard protocols.
.PP
This PMDA exports summary metrics which are performance value aggregations
and configuration per LIO target instance.
Additional, it provides per LUN performance metrics including IOPS, and
READ and WRITE throughput.
.PP
The LIO configuration is maintained within the kernel's
.B configfs
virtual filesystem.
The
.I python-rtslib
module provides an interface to
.BR configfs ,
allowing tools like
.B pmdalio
to interact with the settings and metadata held in
.BR configfs .
.SH INSTALLATION
Install the lio PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdalio\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
