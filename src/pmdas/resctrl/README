LLC PMDA
============

This PMDA exports information about the last level cache.
The metrics are accessed by the PMDA mounting the filesystem
/sys/fs/resctrl, which mounts directories of the form:
/sys/fs/resctrl/mon_data/mon_L3_XX

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT llc

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/llc

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use
    ($PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/llc
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) should be checked for any warnings or
    errors.
