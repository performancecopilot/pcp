Apache PMDA
===========

Export information from apache server info.

Author: Michal Kara

To use this PMDA, you must be running Apache 1.3.2 or later (for the
extended statistics).

First configure your apache http server to enable status support.
The full procedure is documented at
http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_status.html 

Edit /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf or
/etc/apache2/mod_status.conf and enable the following:

<Location /server-status>
  SetHandler server-status
  Allow from all
</Location>
ExtendedStatus On

Note: you may wish to restrict access to the server status reports to
the local host only. See the Apache web site for instructions.

You will need to stop and restart your Apache server after making
this change:
# apachectl restart

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT apache

The metrics give basic information about Apache performance and about usage of
server threads.

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and optionally specify the port number where Apache is running.
    Everything else is automated.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

	# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/apache.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
