@ 156.0 all RAPL components available via /sys filesystem

@ 156.1 all RAPL components available via MSR registers

@ 156.2 set of all batteries reporting charge level

@ 156.3 set of all batteries reporting power

@ 156.4 set of all batteries reporting capacity

@ denki.rapl.sysfs cummulative energy consumption of RAPL components
Cummulative electrical power consumption of x86 hardware components
in units of Joules.

When consecutive samples are rate converted, the units become
Joules / second, or Watts.

The RAPL modules offered by the system are available as metric
instances.

@ denki.rapl.msr cummulative energy consumption of RAPL components
Cummulative electrical power consumption of x86 hardware components
in units of Joules.

When consecutive samples are rate converted, the units become
Joules / second, or Watts.

The RAPL modules offered by the system are available as metric
instances.

@ denki.bat.energy_now battery reported charge level
The current charge level as reported by the battery.  This can
be used to calculate overall power consumption of longer running
compute loads, with high accuracy.

@ denki.bat.power_now system calculated energy consumption
Systems current energy consumption, calculated by the system.
Only available while discharging, or charging the battery.

@ denki.bat.capacity system calculated capacity
Battery capacity, calculated by the driver.
