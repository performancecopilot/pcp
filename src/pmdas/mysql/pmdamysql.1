.TH PMDAMYSQL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdamysql\f1 \- MySQL and MariaDB database PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdamysql\f1 is a Performance Co-Pilot \s-1PMDA\s0 which extracts
live performance data from a running MySQL or MariaDB database.
.SH INSTALLATION
\f3pmdamysql\f1 uses a configuration file from (in this order):
.IP "\(bu" 4
/etc/pcpdbi.conf
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CR$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fR/mysql/mysql.conf
.PP
This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the settings
listed at the start of pmdamysql.pl, namely:
.IP "\(bu" 4
database name (see \s-1\fIDBI\s0\fR\|(3) for details, default is "DBI:mysql:mysql")
.IP "\(bu" 4
database username (default is "dbmonitor")
.IP "\(bu" 4
database password (default is "dbmonitor")
.IP "\(bu" 4
login account (default is "pcp")
.PP
On some versions of MariaDB (10+) the performance schema is disabled by
default, and must be enabled for the PMDA to function.
This is achieved by adding the string "performance_schema" into
the "[mysqld]" section of the MariaDB configuration file (either
.I my.cnf
or
.IR my.ini ).
The "SHOW ENGINES" SQL statement shows support for the performance schema.
.PP
Once these initial setup actions are complete, you can access the names and
values for the mysql performance metrics by doing the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdamysql\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.
.SH "Binary Status values in text"
Some of the status values are in the form of \s-1YES/NO\s0 or \s-1ON/OFF\s0.
.PP
Since these cannot be interpreted by tools like
.BR pmie (1),
they have been duplicated with a _num extension
and the values of 1 (\s-1YES/ON\s0) or 0 (\s-1NO/OFF\s0).

.IP "\fB$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mysql.log\fR" 4
default log file for error messages from \fBpmdamysql\fR
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
