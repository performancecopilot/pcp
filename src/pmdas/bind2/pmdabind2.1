.TH PMDABIND2 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdabind2\f1 \- BIND performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This \s-1PMDA\s0 extracts performance data from BIND (Berkeley Internet
Name Domain).
It enables collection of most of the statistics metrics from the Bind
server version 9 or later, which includes:
.IP \[bu] 2
overall memory statistics
.IP \[bu]
overall per-query statistics (general queries, EDNS/truncated responses, Update/Notify/AXFR/IXFR messages)
.IP \[bu]
overall error statistics (Rejected, SERVFAIL, Update/XFR failures ...)
.IP \[bu]
overall statistics per transport protocol, EDNS and per version of IP protocol
.IP \[bu]
resolver statistics (successes, errors, round-trip times in several ranges)
.IP \[bu]
detailed per-socket statistics with respect to the transport protocol and IP version including errors
.IP \[bu]
detailed per-file-descriptor statistics including errors
.PP
The PMDA performs per-second collection of the whole data set (148 metrics
on the test environment) with modest requirements (2% CPU usage on Intel
i7-4700MQ @2.4 GHz, cca 30 MB RAM).
.P
If more than 1 requests/sec is performed, the memoized values are used so
that the statistics interface of the Bind server does not get overloaded.
.SH INSTALLATION
Configure BIND to export XML statistics via its REST interface.
This requires BIND configuration to enable statistics exporting locally
(at least).
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
statistics-channels {
\    inet 127.0.0.1 port 8080 allow { 127.0.0.1; };
}
options { zone-statistics yes; }
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
The hostname (localhost), port (8080 above) and other configuration
information must be specified in both the BIND configuration file
as well as the
\&\f(CR$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fR/bind2/bind2.conf file.
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2
# [ edit bind2.conf ]
\  host=localhost.localdomain:8080
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
bind2 performance metrics by doing the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdabind2\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.
.SH FILES
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/bind2.conf\fR" 4
mandatory configuration file listing monitored bind2 instances
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/Install\fR" 4
installation script for the \fBpmdabind2\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/Remove\fR" 4
undo installation script for the \fBpmdabind2\fR agent
.IP "\fB$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/bind2.log\fR" 4
default log file for error messages from \fBpmdabind2\fR
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
