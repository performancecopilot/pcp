.TH PMDAMSSQL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdamssql\f1 \- Microsoft SQL Server database PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmdamssql\fP is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts live performance data from a running
Microsoft SQL Server database server.
.SH CONFIGURATION
Firstly, \f3pmdamssql\f1 requires installation of these support packages:
.TP 5
.B mssql-server
The primary Microsoft SQL Server database package.
.TP
.BR msodbcsql17 " or (" msodbcsql )
Latest Microsoft SQL Server ODBC bindings.
.TP
.B pyodbc
General Python ODBC module with Microsoft SQL Server support enabled.
.PP
Next, \fBpmdamssql\fP reads an optional ini-style configuration file:
.IP
.PD 0
.IP
.I \f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/mssql/mssql.conf
.PD
.PP
This file currently allows for two sections, one for configuring the
library that connects to SQL server, the other for authenticating with
SQL server.
.PP
.B [connection]
section specifies values for the following settings
(their default values are shown in parenthesis):
.TP 15
.B driver \fR(\fP\fI{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}\fP\fR)\fP
ODBC driver string.
.TP
.B server \fR(\fP\fItcp:localhost\fP\fR)\fP
SQL Server socket connection string.
.TP
.B timeout \fR(\fP\fI2\fP\fR)\fP
Connection timeout setting, in seconds.
.PP
.B [authentication]
section specifies values for the following settings
(their default values are shown in parenthesis):
.TP 15
.B username \fR(\fP\fIsa\fP\fR)\fP
Username to connect to the database.
.TP
.B password \fR(unset)\fP
Password to connect to the database.
.PD
.SH INSTALLATION
To install, the following must be done as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdamssql\fP is launched by \fBpmcd\fP(1) and should never be
executed directly.
The \fBInstall\fP and \fBRemove\fP scripts notify \fBpmcd\fP(1) when
the agent is installed or removed.
.PP
\fBpmdamssql\fR will automatically attempt to reconnect to the SQL Server
if its connection is lost - e.g. if the SQL Server service is restarted.
.SH FILES
.TP 5
.I \f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/mssql/mssql.conf
configuration file for the \fBpmdamssql\fR agent
.TP
.I \f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/mssql/Install
installation script for the \fBpmdamssql\fR agent
.TP
.I \f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/mssql/Remove
undo installation script for the \fBpmdamssql\fR agent
.TP
.I \f(CW$PCP_LOG_DIR\fP/pmcd/mssql.log
default log file for messages from the \fBpmdamssql\fR agent
.PP
Note that the usual/default value for \fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP is
.B /var/lib/pcp/pmdas
and the default for \fB$PCP_LOG_DIR\fP is
.B /var/log/pcp
but these settings are platform dependent.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fR(5).
