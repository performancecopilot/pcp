.TH PMDAGLUSTER 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdagluster\f1 \- Gluster Filesystem PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdagluster\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
metric values about mounted gluster filesystems using the
.BR gluster (8)
command.
This PMDA exports metrics about volumes and bricks both local and remote to
the node where pmdagluster is running.
.PP
The gluster filesystem supports fine-grained control over enabling statistics
on individual volumes, so that the values are optionally enabled or disabled
on systems where they are not desired to be monitored.
.PP
The
.BR pmstore (1)
command can be used to enable and disable profiling of volumes.
Using the individual instances of the gluster.volume.profile metric,
one can set their values (and associated profiling) either on (1) or off (0).
Additionally,
.BR pminfo (1)
can report on the current status of profiling of each volume.

.SH INSTALLATION
Install the gluster PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gluster
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:

# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdagluster\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
