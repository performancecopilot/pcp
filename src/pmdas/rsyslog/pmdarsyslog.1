.TH PMDARSYSLOG 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdarsyslog\f1 \- rsyslog (reliable and extended syslog) PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdarsyslog\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0)
which exports metric values from the \fBrsyslogd\fR\|(8) server.
.PP
Further details about rsyslog can be found at
.BR http://www.rsyslog.com/ .
.SH INSTALLATION
If you want access to the names and values for the rsyslog performance
metrics, do the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdarsyslog\fR is launched by \fBpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fBpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.
.PP
In order to use this agent, rsyslog stats gathering must be enabled.
This is done by adding the lines:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
module(load="impstats" interval="10" severity="7")
if $syslogtag contains 'rsyslogd-pstats' then {
    action(
        name="pstats-for-pcp"
        type="ompipe"
        template="RSYSLOG_FileFormat"
        pipe="/var/log/pcp/rsyslog/stats"
    )
    stop
}
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
to your \fIrsyslog.conf\fR\|(5) configuration file after installing the \s-1PMDA\s0.

the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
