@ proc.runq.unknown number of processes is an unknown state
Instantaneous number of processes is an unknown state, including all
kernel threads
@ proc.runq.kernel number of kernel threads
Instantaneous number of processes with virtual size of zero (kernel threads)

@ proc.control.all.threads process indom includes threads
If set to one, the process instance domain as reported by pmdaproc
contains all threads as well as the processes that started them.
If set to zero, the process instance domain contains only processes.

This setting is persistent for the life of pmdaproc and affects all
client tools that request instances and values from pmdaproc.
Use either pmstore(1) or pmStore(3) to modify this metric.

@ proc.control.perclient.threads for a client, process indom includes threads
If set to one, the process instance domain as reported by pmdaproc
contains all threads as well as the processes that started them.
If set to zero, the process instance domain contains only processes.

This setting is only visible to the active client context.  In other
words, storing into this metric has no effect for other monitoring
tools.  See proc.control.all.threads, if that is the desired outcome.
Only pmStore(3) can effectively set this metric (pmstore(1) cannot).

@ proc.control.perclient.cgroups for a client, process indom reflects specific cgroups
If set to the empty string (the default), the process instance domain
as reported by pmdaproc contains all processes.  However, a cgroup
name (full path) can be stored into this metric in order to restrict
processes reported to only those within the specified cgroup.  This
set is further affected by the value of proc.control.perclient.threads.

This setting is only visible to the active client context.  In other
words, storing into this metric has no effect for other monitoring
tools.  pmStore(3) must be used to set this metric (not pmstore(1)).

The total time duration (in nanoseconds) for which entities of the
group have been throttled by the CFS scheduler - refer to discussion
in Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt in the kernel source.

@ cgroup.cpusched.cfs_quota Total available runtime within a period (usec)
The bandwidth allowed for a CFS group is specified using a quota and period.
Within each given "period" (usec), a group is allowed to consume only up to
"quota" usec of CPU time.  When the CPU bandwidth consumption of a group
exceeds this limit (for that period), the tasks belonging to its hierarchy
will be throttled and are not allowed to run again until the next period.

A value of -1 indicates that the group does not have bandwidth restriction
in place.  Refer to discussion in Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt in
the kernel source.

@ cgroup.cpusched.cfs_period The length of a CFS period (usec)
The bandwidth allowed for a CFS group is specified using a quota and period.
Within each given "period" (usec), a group is allowed to consume only up to
"quota" usec of CPU time.  When the CPU bandwidth consumption of a group
exceeds this limit (for that period), the tasks belonging to its hierarchy
will be throttled and are not allowed to run again until the next period.

@ hotproc.control.refresh time in secs between refreshes
Controls how long it takes before the "interesting" process list is refreshed
and new cpuburn times (see hotproc.cpuburn) calculated.  This value can be
changed at any time by using pmstore(1). Once the value is changed, the instances
will not be available until after the new refresh period has elapsed.

@ hotproc.control.config configuration predicate
The configuration predicate that is used to characterize "interesting"
processes.  This will initially be the predicate as specified in the
configuration file.  This value can be changed at any time by using
pmstore(1).  Once the value is changed, the instances will not be available
until after the refresh period has elapsed.

@ hotproc.control.config_gen configuration generation number
Each time the configuration predicate is updated (see hotproc.control.config)
the configuration generation number is incremented.

@ hotproc.control.reload_config force the config file to be reloaded
Instructs the pmda to reload its configuration file.  This value can be
changed at any time by using pmstore(1). Once the value is changed, the instances
will not be available until after the new refresh period has elapsed.

@ hotproc.total.cpuburn total amount of cpuburn over all "interesting" processes
The sum of the CPU utilization ("cpuburn" or the fraction of time that each
process was executing in user or system mode over the last refresh interval)
for all the "interesting" processes.

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

@ hotproc.total.cpuidle fraction of CPU idle time
The fraction of all CPU time classified as idle over the last refresh
interval.

@ hotproc.total.cpuother.not_cpuburn total amount of cpuburn over all uninteresting processes
The sum of the CPU utilization ("cpuburn" or the fraction of time that
each process was executing in user or system mode over the last refresh
interval) for all the "uninteresting" processes.  If this value is high in
comparison to hotproc.total.cpuburn, then configuration predicate of the
hotproc PMDA is classifying a significant fraction of the CPU utilization
to processes that are not "interesting".

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

@ hotproc.total.cpuother.transient fraction of time utilized by "transient" processes
The total CPU utilization (fraction of time that each process was executing
in user or system mode) for processes which are not present throughout
the most recent refreshes interval.  The hotproc PMDA is limited to
selecting processes which are present throughout each refresh intervals.
If processes come and/or go during a refresh interval then they will never
be considered.  This metric gives an indication of the level of activity of
these "transient" processes.  If the value is large in comparison to the
sum of hotproc.total.cpuburn and hotproc.total.cpuother.not_cpuburn then
the "transient" processes are consuming lots of CPU time.  Under these
circumstances, the hotproc PMDA may be less useful, or consideration
should be given to decreasing the value of the refresh interval
(hotproc.control.refresh) so fewer "transient" processes escape
consideration.

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

@ hotproc.total.cpuother.total total amount of cpuburn other than the "interesting" processes
Non-idle CPU utilization not accounted for by processes other than those
deemed "interesting".  It is equivalent to hotproc.total.cpuother.not_cpuburn
+ hotproc.total.cpuother.transient.

Values are in the range 0 to the number of CPUs.

@ hotproc.total.cpuother.percent how much of the cpu for "transients" and uninterestings
Gives an indication of how much of the CPU time the "transient" processes
and the "uninteresting" processes are accounting for.  Computed as:
    100 * hotproc.total.cpuother.total / number of CPUs

@ hotproc.predicate.cpuburn CPU utilization per "interesting" process
CPU utilization, or the fraction of time that each "interesting" process
was executing (user and system time) over the last refresh interval.
Also known as the "cpuburn" time.

@ hotproc.predicate.ctxswitch number of context switches per second over refresh interval
The number of context switches per second over the last refresh interval
for each "interesting" process.

@ hotproc.predicate.virtualsize virtual size of process in kilobytes at last refresh
The virtual size of each "interesting" process in kilobytes at the last
refresh time.

@ hotproc.predicate.residentsize resident size of process in kilobytes at last refresh
The resident size of each "interesting" process in kilobytes at the last
refresh.

@ hotproc.predicate.iodemand total kilobytes read and written per second over refresh interval
The total kilobytes read and written per second over the last refresh
interval for each "interesting" process.

@ hotproc.predicate.iowait time in secs waiting for I/O per second over refresh interval
The fraction of time waiting for I/O for each "interesting" process over
refresh interval.

@ hotproc.predicate.schedwait time in secs waiting on run queue per second over refresh interval
The fraction of time waiting on the run queue for each "interesting"
process over the last refresh interval.
