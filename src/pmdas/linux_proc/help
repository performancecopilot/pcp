This field needs access to a namelist file for proper 
address-to-symbol name translation. If no namelist file
is available, the address is printed instead. The namelist
file must match the current Linux kernel exactly.
The search path for the namelist file is as follows:
	/boot/System.map-`uname -r`
	/boot/System.map
	/lib/modules/`uname -r`/System.map
	/usr/src/linux/System.map
	/System.map

@ proc.io.rchar read(), readv() and sendfile() receive bytes
Extended accounting information - count of the number of bytes that
have passed over the read(2), readv(2) and sendfile(2) syscalls by
each process.

@ proc.io.wchar write(), writev() and sendfile() send bytes
Extended accounting information - count of the number of bytes that
have passed over the write(2), writev(2) and sendfile(2) syscalls by
each process.

@ proc.io.syscr read(), readv() and sendfile() receive system calls
Extended accounting information - count of number of calls to the
read(2), readv(2) and sendfile(2) syscalls by each process.

@ proc.io.syscw write(), writev() and sendfile() send system calls
Extended accounting information - count of number of calls to the
write(2), writev(2) and sendfile(2) syscalls by each process.

@ proc.io.read_bytes physical device read bytes
Number of bytes physically read on by devices on behalf of this process.
@ proc.io.write_bytes physical device write bytes
Number of bytes physically written to devices on behalf of this process.
This must be reduced by any truncated I/O (proc.io.cancelled_write_bytes).
@ proc.io.cancelled_write_bytes physical device write cancelled bytes
Number of bytes cancelled via truncate by this process.  Actual physical
writes for an individual process can be calculated as:
	proc.io.write_bytes - proc.io.cancelled_write_bytes.

@ proc.schedstat.cpu_time runnable (scheduled) + run time
Length of time in nanoseconds that a process has been running, including
scheduling time.
@ proc.schedstat.run_delay run queue time
Length of time in nanoseconds that a process spent waiting to be scheduled
to run in the run queue.
@ proc.schedstat.pcount number of times a process is allowed to run
Number of times a process has been scheduled to run on a CPU (this is
incremented when a task actually reaches a CPU to run on, not simply
when it is added to the run queue).

@ proc.fd.count open file descriptors
Number of file descriptors this process has open.

@ proc.control.all.threads process indom includes threads
If set to one, the process instance domain as reported by pmdaproc
contains all threads as well as the processes that started them.
If set to zero, the process instance domain contains only processes.

This setting is persistent for the life of pmdaproc and affects all
client tools that request instances and values from pmdaproc.
Use either pmstore(1) or pmStore(3) to modify this metric.

@ proc.control.perclient.threads for a client, process indom includes threads
If set to one, the process instance domain as reported by pmdaproc
contains all threads as well as the processes that started them.
If set to zero, the process instance domain contains only processes.

This setting is only visible to the active client context.  In other
words, storing into this metric has no effect for other monitoring
tools.  See proc.control.all.threads, if that is the desired outcome.
Only pmStore(3) can effectively set this metric (pmstore(1) cannot).

@ proc.control.perclient.cgroups for a client, process indom reflects specific cgroups
If set to the empty string (the default), the process instance domain
as reported by pmdaproc contains all processes.  However, a cgroup
name (full path) can be stored into this metric in order to restrict
processes reported to only those within the specified cgroup.  This
set is further affected by the value of proc.control.perclient.threads.

This setting is only visible to the active client context.  In other
words, storing into this metric has no effect for other monitoring
tools.  pmStore(3) must be used to set this metric (not pmstore(1)).
