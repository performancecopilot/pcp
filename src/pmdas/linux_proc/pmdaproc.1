.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdaproc
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
performance metrics describing the state of the individual
processes running on a Linux system.
.PP
The
.B proc
PMDA exports metrics that measure the memory, processor and
other resource use of each process, as well as summary information
collated across all of the running processes.
The PMDA uses credentials passed from the
.BR PMAPI (3)
monitoring tool identifying the user requesting the information,
to ensure that only values the user is allowed to access are
returned by the PMDA.
This involves the PMDA temporarily changing its effective user and
group identifiers for the duration of requests for instances and
values.
In other words, system calls to extract information are performed
as the user originating the request and not as a privileged user.
The mechanisms available for transfer of user credentials are
described further in the
.BR PCPIntro (1)
page.
.PP
A brief description of the
.B pmdaproc
command line options follows:
.TP 5
.B \-A
Disables use of the credentials provided by
.B PMAPI
client tools,
and simply runs everything under the "root" account.
.TP
.B \-L
Changes the per-process instance domain used by most
.B procproc
metrics to include threads as well.
.TP
.B \-d
It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
.I domain
number specified here is unique and consistent.
That is,
.I domain
should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
.TP
.B \-l
Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
.I proc.log
is written in the current directory of
.BR pmcd (1)
when
.B pmdaproc
is started, i.e.
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot
be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
.TP
.B \-r
Restrict the set of processes exported in the per-process instance domain
to only those processes that are contained by the specified
.IR cgroup
resource container.
This option provides an optional finer granularity to the monitoring, and
can also be used to reduce the resources consumed by
.I pmdaproc
during requests for instances and values.
.TP
.B \-U
User account under which to run the agent.
The default is the privileged "root" account, with
seteuid (2)
and
setegid (2)
switching for accessing most information.
.SH HOTPROC OVERVIEW
The
.B pmdaproc
Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) includes an additional set of
per-process metrics with an instance domain of processes restricted
to an "interesting" or "hot" set.
Unlike the stock metrics exported by the
.B proc
PMDA, which have an instance domain equal to the current processes,
.B hot
metrics have an instance domain which is a subset of this.
This
.B hotproc
instance domain is determined by a configurable predicate evaluated
over some refresh interval.
.P
As well as the equivalent per-process
.B proc
metrics,
.B hotproc
provides a \f3cpuburn\f1 metric which specifies the CPU utilization
of the process over the refresh interval, \f3total\f1 metrics which
indicate how much of the available CPU time the "interesting" processes
account for, \f3predicate\f1 metrics which show the values of
the reserved variables (see below) that are being used in the hotproc
predicate, and \f3control\f1 metrics for controlling the agent.
.PP
.SH HOTPROC CONFIGURATION
The configuration file consists of one predicate used to determine if
a process should be in the interesting set or not.
.PP
An example configuration file may be found at
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/samplehotproc.conf
.PP
This file with any modifications can be copied to
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/hotproc.conf
in order to configure the
.B hot
metrics. The
.BR pmstore (1)
and
.BR pmStore (3)
interfaces can be used as well (described below).
.PP
The predicate is described using the language specified below.
The symbols are based on those used by the
.BR C (1)
and
.BR awk (1)
languages.
.TP
Boolean Connectives
.B &&
(and),
.B ||
(or),
.B !
(not),
.B ()

Reserved variables
.B uid

.B uname
(user name; type string),
.B gid
(group id; type integer)
.B gname
(group name; type string),
.B fname
(process file name; type string),
.B psargs
(process file name with args; type string),
.B cpuburn

.B iodemand

.TP

.B 0.35
(positive float),
\f3"foobar"\f1
(string; delimited by \f3"\f1),
.B /[fF](o)+bar/
(pattern; delimited by \f3/\f1),
.B true
(boolean),
.B false
(boolean)
.TP
Comments
.B #this is a comment
(from \f3#\f1 to the end of the line).
.TP
Examples
  cpuburn > 0.2 # cpu utilization of more than 20%
  cpuburn > 0.2 && uname == "root"
  cpuburn > 0.2 && (uname == "root" || uname == "hot")
  psargs ~ /pmda/ && cpuburn > 0.4

.PP
The \f3hotproc.predicate\f1 metrics may be used
to see what the values of the reserved variables are
that were used by the predicate at the last refresh.
They do not cover the reserved variables which are
already exported elsewhere. A \f3hotproc.predicate\f1 metric
may not have a value if it is not referenced in the configuration
predicate.

.SH DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION
The
.B hot
metrics can also be configured at runtime through the
.BR pmstore (1)
interface (and, implicitly, the
.BR pmStore (3)
API)
.TP
Examples
  pmstore hotproc.control.config 'fname == "mingetty"'
  pmstore hotproc.control.config 'uid == 0'
.TP
To force the config file to be reloaded:
  pmstore hotproc.control.reload_config "1"
.SH INSTALLATION
The
.B proc
PMDA is installed and available by default.
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CW
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to establish access to the names, help text and values for the proc
performance metrics once more, after removal, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CW
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
.B pmdaproc
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.

.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
