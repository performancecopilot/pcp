.TH PMDAROOMTEMP 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdaroomtemp\f1 \- room temperature performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp/pmdaroomtemp\f1
[\f3\-d\f1 \f2domain\f1]
[\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdaroomtemp
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports the
temperature from one or more sensors built using the DS2480 and
DS1280 chipsets and MicroLAN technology from Dallas Semiconductor
Corporation.
.PP
The
.B roomtemp
PMDA exports metrics that reflect the temperatures from one or
more of these devices, in both degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Each metric has one instance for each temperature sensor device.
The external instance identifiers are the serial numbers (in hex)
of the DS1280 chips discovered when the MicroLAN was probed.
.PP
A brief description of the
.B pmdaroomtemp
command line options follows:
.TP 5
.B \-d
It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
.I domain
number specified here is unique and consistent.
That is,
.I domain
should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
.I domain
number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
.TP
.B \-l
Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
.I roomtemp.log
is written in the current directory of
.BR pmcd (1)
when
.B pmdaroomtemp
is started, i.e.
.BR $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .
If the log file cannot
be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
.SH INSTALLATION
If you want access to the names, help text and values for the roomtemp
performance metrics, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/roomtemp
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
.B pmdaroomtemp
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.

.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
