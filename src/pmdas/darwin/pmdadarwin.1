.TH PMDADARWIN 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdadarwin\f1 \- Darwin (macOS) kernel PMDA
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/darwin/pmdadarwin\f1
[\f3\-d\f1 \f2domain\f1]
[\f3\-l\f1 \f2logfile\f1]
[\f3\-U\f1 \f2username\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdadarwin
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
performance metrics from the macOS (Darwin) kernel.
.PP
The
.B darwin
PMDA exports metrics that examine memory utilization, virtual memory statistics,
network interface statistics, disk I/O statistics, TCP connection states, and
various protocol statistics including TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
.SH TCP STATISTICS CONFIGURATION
On macOS, access to detailed TCP protocol statistics is controlled
by the kernel sysctl parameter
.BR net.inet.tcp.disable_access_to_stats .
By default, this is set to 1 (disabled) for privacy and security.
.PP
When disabled, all
.B network.tcp.*
metrics (except connection state counts from
.BR network.tcpconn.* )
will report zero values.
The PMDA will log a warning message on startup if TCP statistics
access is detected to be disabled.
.SS Manual Configuration
To enable TCP statistics manually, run as root:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
.ft B
$ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.disable_access_to_stats=0
.ft P
.fi
.in
.PP
To make this permanent across reboots, add to
.BR /etc/sysctl.conf :
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
.ft B
net.inet.tcp.disable_access_to_stats=0
.ft P
.fi
.in
.PP
Note: This setting is not protected by System Integrity Protection (SIP)
and can be modified as root.
.SH INSTALLATION
The darwin PMDA is installed and available by default on macOS systems.
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
.ft B
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/darwin
# ./Remove
.ft P
.fi
.in
.PP
If you want to enable the PMDA again, do the following as root:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
.ft B
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/darwin
# ./Install
.ft P
.fi
.in
.PP
.B pmdadarwin
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.BR pmcd (1)
when the agent is installed or removed.
.SH FILES
.TP 5
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/darwin/help
default help text file for the darwin metrics
.TP
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/darwin/Install
installation script for the darwin PMDA
.TP
.B $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/darwin/Remove
undo installation script for the darwin PMDA
.TP
.B $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/darwin.log
default log file for error and diagnostic messages from the darwin PMDA
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
