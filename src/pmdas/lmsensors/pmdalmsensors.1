.TH PMDALMSENSORS 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot" ""
.SH NAME
\f3pmdalmsensors\f1 \- Linux hardware monitoring performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/pmdalmsensors\f1
[\f3debug\f1]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B pmdalmsensors
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
performance metrics describing the state of hardware using
the lm-sensors software on compatible motherboards.
.PP
The
.B lmsensors
PMDA exports metrics that measure fan speeds and core temperatures.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
If you want access to the names, help text and values for the lmsensors
performance metrics, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors
# ./Install
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
.PP
.ft CR
.nf
.in +0.5i
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors
# ./Remove
.in
.fi
.ft 1
.PP
pmdalmsensors.python is usually launched by pmcd (1), and not
executed directly. Direct execution is mostly used for debugging
purposes.

The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd (1) when the agent
is installed or removed.
.SH "OPTIONS"
pmdalmsensors.python supports the following options.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inject\fR
inject data from file instead of using sensors
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
debug level: 0 (default), 1 or 2
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show a help message

To use options while pmdalmsensors.python is run from PMCD,
you might want to use 'args' in the 'Install' stript, for
example

args="\-i /path/static_sensors_output.txt"

.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
