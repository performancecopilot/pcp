@ 19.0 shping command instance domain
There is one instance for each command run by the shping PMDA.

The external instance name comes from the "tag" in the shping PMDA
configuration file.  The internal instance number is the ordinal
command number in the configuration file.

@ shping.error command execution error code for shping PMDA
As each command is executed, if there is a problem, the error
code or cause is stored in shping.error.

The interpretation of the value for shping.error depends on
shping.status as follows:

    If shping.status is 1 (the command was run but returned a non-zero
    exit status) then shping.error is the exit status.

    If shping.status is 2 (the command was run but was terminated by
    a signal) then shping.error is the signal number.

    If shping.status is 3 (the command did not complete) then
    shping.error is a PCP error codes: see pmerr(1).  Of particular
    relevance is -12353 (PM_ERR_TIMEOUT) when the command failed to
    complete in the time specified by shping.control.timeout.

    If shping.status is 4 (the commands was not run) then shping.error
    is the value of the system error code.

    Otherwise shping.error will be zero.

@ shping.status command execution status for shping PMDA
As each command is executed, the success or failure is encoded in
shping.status, using the following values:

   -1   PMDA is initializing and command has not been run yet
    0	command completed and exit status was 0
    1	command completed and exit status was non-zero
    2	command was run but terminated by a signal
    3	command was run but did not complete (usually a timeout)
    4   command was not run due to some system error or resource
	availability

@ shping.time.real elapsed time for a command
This metric records the elapsed time in milliseconds for the most recent
execution of each command to be run by the shping PMDA.

Care should be used when interpreting the value if the corresponding
value for shping.status is non-zero, as the command may not have run to
completion.  If the command timed out, shping.time.real will be -1.

@ shping.time.cpu_usr user mode CPU time for a command
This metric records the user mode CPU time in milliseconds for the most
recent execution of each command to be run by the shping PMDA.

Care should be used when interpreting the value if the corresponding
value for shping.status is non-zero, as the command may not have run to
completion.  If the command timed out, shping.time.cpu_usr will be -1.

@ shping.time.cpu_sys system mode CPU time for a command
This metric records the system mode CPU time in milliseconds for the most
recent execution of each command to be run by the shping PMDA.

Care should be used when interpreting the value if the corresponding
value for shping.status is non-zero, as the command may not have run to
completion.  If the command timed out, shping.time.cpu_sys will be -1.

@ shping.cmd commands run by shping PMDA
The text of each sh(1) command run by the shping PMDA.

@ shping.control.numcmd number of commands in the group to be run by the shping PMDA

@ shping.control.cycles number of times the command group has been run by the shping PMDA

@ shping.control.cycletime shping PMDA cycle time
All commands are run by the shping PMDA are executed one after another
in a group, and the group is run once per "cycle" time.  This metric
reports the cycle time in seconds.

The cycle time may be changed dynamically by modifying this metric
with pmstore(1).

@ shping.control.timeout shping PMDA timeout period
The number of seconds the shping PMDA is willing to wait before
considering a single command to have timed out and killing it off.

The time out interval may be changed dynamically by modifying this
metric with pmstore(1).

@ shping.control.debug shping PMDA debug flag
The debug flag for the shping PMDA (see pmdbg(1)).  All trace and
diagnostic files are created in $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.

The debug flags DBG_TRACE_APPL0 (2048) and DBG_TRACE_APPL1 (4096)
may be used as follows:

DBG_TRACE_APPL0	- additional trace messages associated with the running
		  of each command appear in shping.log

DBG_TRACE_APPL1	- the standard output and standard error of each command
		  is appended to shping.out (instead of the default
		  /dev/null)

The debug flags may be changed dynamically by modifying this
metric with pmstore(1), e.g.
	$ pmstore shping.control.debug 6144
would enable both of the diagnostic traces associated with
DBG_TRACE_APPL0 and DBG_TRACE_APPL1.
