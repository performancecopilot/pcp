.TH PMDANGINX 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdanginx\f1 \- nginx performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdanginx\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0) which
exports performance metrics from
.BR nginx (8)
\- an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic
TCP proxy server.
.SH INSTALLATION
This \s-1PMDA\s0 requires that the
.B nginx
stub_status module is active and available at http://localhost/nginx_status
.PP
In order to enable this module, the "server" section of the
.I nginx.conf
configuration file should contain the following.
.de CS
.in +0.5i
.ft CW
.nf
..
.de CE
.fi
.ft 1
.in
..
.PP
.CS
location /nginx_status {
    stub_status on;
    access_log off;
    allow 127.0.0.1;
    allow ::1;
    deny all;
}
.CE
.PP
Instrumentation availability can be verified using these
commands (compile-time then run-time checks):
.PP
      # nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -o with-http_stub_status_module
      # curl http://localhost/nginx_status
.PP
Install the nginx \s-1PMDA\s0 by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nginx
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nginx
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdanginx\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed 
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the 
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables. 
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative 
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
