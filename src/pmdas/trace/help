@ TRACE.0 Instance domain of transaction tags for the trace PMDA
There is one instance for each transaction tag (from a call to pmtracebegin)
which has been seen by the trace PMDA during the reporting period.
The trace.transact.* metrics are enumerated over this instance domain.

@ TRACE.1 Instance domain of point tags for the trace PMDA
There is one instance for each point tag (from a call to pmtracepoint)
which has been seen by the trace PMDA during the reporting period.
The trace.point.* metrics are enumerated over this instance domain.

@ TRACE.2 Instance domain of observation tags for the trace PMDA
There is one instance for each observation tag (from a call to pmtraceobs)
which has been seen by the trace PMDA during the reporting period.
The trace.observe.* metrics are enumerated over this instance domain.

@ TRACE.3 Instance domain of counter tags for the trace PMDA
There is one instance for each counter tag (from a call to pmtracecounter)
which has been seen by the trace PMDA during the reporting period.
The trace.counter.* metrics are enumerated over this instance domain.

@ trace.transact.count count by transaction
Count by transaction tag of transactions serviced since the trace
PMDA was started.

@ trace.transact.rate transaction completion rate over time period
The rate at which each transaction is completed, calculated over the
trace PMDAs aggregation period.

The exported value is equal to the count of transactions completed
during the aggregation interval, divided by the aggregation interval.

@ trace.transact.ave_time average transaction time over time period
The average time taken to complete each transaction, calculated over
the trace PMDAs aggregation period.

The exported value is equal to the sum of the transaction completion
times seen during the aggregation interval divided by the number of
transactions completed during the aggregation interval.

@ trace.transact.max_time maximum time per transaction
Maximum recorded service time per transaction tag within the current
reporting period.

@ trace.transact.min_time minimum time per transaction
Minimum recorded service time per transaction tag within the current
reporting period.

@ trace.transact.total_time total time per transaction
Cumulative time spent processing each transaction since the trace PMDA
was started.

@ trace.point.count count of point function executions
Count by point tag of marked application points serviced since the
trace PMDA was started.

@ trace.point.rate point rate over time period
The rate at which execution points are completed, calculated over the
aggregation period in use by the trace PMDA.

The exported value is equal to the count of successful pmtracepoint(3)
calls made during the aggregation interval, divided by the aggregation
interval.

@ trace.counter.count count of counter values received
Count, by counter tag, of `counter' values received since the trace
PMDA was started.

@ trace.counter.rate counter value received rate over time period
The rate at which execution counters are received, calculated over
the aggregation period in use by the trace PMDA.

The exported value is equal to the count of pmtracecounter(3) calls made
during the aggregation interval, divided by the aggregation interval.

@ trace.counter.value counter value at last observation
The numeric counter value associated with the last seen counter tag,
since the trace PMDA was started.

@ trace.observe.count count of observations
Count, by observation tag, of application `observe' points serviced
since the trace PMDA was started.

@ trace.observe.rate observation rate over time period
The rate at which execution observations are completed, calculated
over the aggregation period in use by the trace PMDA.

The exported value is equal to the count of pmtraceobs(3) calls made
during the aggregation interval, divided by the aggregation interval.

@ trace.observe.value value at last observation
The numeric value associated with the last seen observation, since
the trace PMDA was started.

@ trace.control.period reporting time period
Time (in seconds) over which trace performance data will be gathered.
Any transaction or point trace data seen by the trace PMDA during the
period will be included in the set of exported values.

@ trace.control.interval update interval within time period
The update interval (within the overall period) at which the current
working set of performance data maintained within the trace PMDA will
be switched into the set of historical data buffers, which are then
used to calculate the exported performance metric values.
This value is directly calculated from the overall time period and the
number of buckets of historical data being maintained within the trace
PMDA.

For example, if the overall period is 60 seconds and the number of
historical data buckets being maintained is 12, then the buffers will
be rotated once every 5 seconds.

@ trace.control.buckets number of historical buffers
The number of buffers of historical data maintained by the trace PMDA.
Each bucket contains all transaction and event performance data seen
over a set time interval within the overall reporting time period.

@ trace.control.port port number for client connections
The TCP/IP port number which the trace PMDA is waiting for client
connections on.

This has been set as either the default (4322), via the command line,
or via the PMDA_TRACE_PORT environment variable when the trace PMDA
was started.

@ trace.control.reset clear all tags known to the trace PMDA
Storing any value into this metric with pmstore(1) will cause the trace
PMDA to clear all tags for all metrics from its historical buffers and
begin afresh.

This is most useful when the instance domains of the trace metrics have
become cluttered with unwanted instances, and the instance domains need
to be refreshed without restarting pmcd(1).

@ trace.control.debug set the debug level in the trace PMDA
Storing values into this metric with pmstore(1) allows the level of
diagnostic output from the trace PMDA to be controlled.

By default, the diagnostic output will be written to the file
$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/trace.log.
