# action definitions applicable to all rules follow
# 
# o  $rule$ defined locally & contains the "message" to be propagated
#
# o  $*_expand$ often overridden locally & contains the part of the
#    action string which is rule-semantics specific and will be expanded
#    possibly multiple times on truthful evaluation of the predicate to
#    contain values/instances/hosts which matched,e.g:
#    "%v@%h" might expand to "1.1@moomba 1.7@rattle 4.5@wobbly" if all
#    the rule is true for all of the hosts moomba, rattle and wobbly.
#
#    some common alternatives:
#	%i@%h		(inst@host)
#	%h		(host)
#	%v[%i]@%h	(value:inst@host)
#	%v%@%h		(value%@host)
