"For at least one network interface, the average rate of packet
transfers (in and/or out) exceeded the threshold during the last
sample interval.
This rule is disabled by default because the per_netif.util rule
is more generally useful as it takes into consideration each
network interfaces' reported bandwidth.  However, there are some
situations in which this value is zero, in which case an absolute
threshold-based rule like this one will make more sense (for this
reason it should typically be applied to some network interfaces,
but not others - use the \"interfaces\" variable to filter this).";

"May be set to a list of network interfaces for which the rule will
be evaluated, as a subset of configured network interfaces.
Network interfaces should be separated by white space and may be
enclosed in single quotes, eg.  \"ec0 'xpi5' ec2\".  Use the command:
	$ pminfo -f network.interface.mtu
to discover the names of the installed network interfaces.
This is most useful to remove the loopback, SLIP and PPP interfaces
from the rule evaluations.";
