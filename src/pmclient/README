pmclient - sample clients using the PMAPI
=========================================

pmclient is a sample client that uses the Performance Metrics
Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) to report some performance
data, collected from either a local host, a remote host, or a
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) performance metrics archive.

The pmclient_fg program differs to pmclient in that it uses the
fetchgroup API extension to the PMAPI, see pmFetchGroup(3).

A script implementation in the python language, pmclient_fg.python,
is also provided for reference.

The binaries are shipped as part of pcp and are typically installed
in /usr/bin/pmclient[_fg].  A pmclient(1) "man" page is shipped in
the pcp documentation package also.

The source is shipped as part of the pcp development packages and
is installed in $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/pmclient.  If you have a C compiler
installed, the source and Makefile in this directory may be used to
create functionally equivalent binaries, by entering the command

	% make

The source in pmclient.c demonstrates many of the PMAPI services, and
may be used as a template and style guide when creating your own PMAPI
clients.  Note in particular, the use of ./pmnsmap.spec and the shipped
tool pmgenmap(1) to assist in the creation of arguments to the PMAPI
routines, and the manipulation of PMAPI data structures.

To experiment with the archives,

	% rm -f mylog.*
	% config=$PCP_DEMOS_DIR/pmclient/pmlogger.config
	% cat $config
	% pmlogger -c $config -s 6 mylog

this will collect 30 seconds of performance data into the archive
stored as the files mylog.*.  To play this back,

	% pmclient -a mylog
