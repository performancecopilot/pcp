.SH DESCRIPTION
.B guidellm2pcp
is a performance metrics importer tool that creates a PCP archive
from the JSON results of a GuideLLM benchmark.
.PP
An archive spanning the time for which the benchmark and its run
iterations were active.
Discrete PCP metrics are created for each recorded aspect of a run,
and logged once at the start and once at the end of each iteration,
followed by a mark record.
.PP
This allows PCP tools to report on these metrics in a meaningful way
alongside other system (kernel, hardware, vLLM, and so on) metrics
gathered during the benchmark.
.PP
The only mandatory command line argument is the JSON
.I results
file from a GuideLLM invocation.
This JSON can optionally be wrapped with additional Model Furnace
metadata, and if this is detected additional PCP labels will be
extracted and stored (such as model and inference server names).
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-a\fR \fIarchive\fR, \fB\-\-archive\fR=\fIarchive\fR
Specified the name of the output PCP
.I archive
to be produced.
By default, an archive name using the timestamp of the start of
the benchmark run will be used.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR \fIhostname\fR, \fB\-\-hostname\fR=\fIhostname\fR
Sets the
.I hostname
that will be stamped into the PCP archive label header.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report progress as each run is identified and its values saved.
