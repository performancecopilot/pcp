.TH PCP-COLLECTL 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmcollectl\f1,
\f3pcp-collectl\f1 \- collect data that describes the current system status
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pcp\ collectl\f1
[\f3\-f\f1 \f2file\f1 | \f3\-p\f1 \f2file\f1 ...]
\f2[options\f1 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-collectl
is a system-level performance monitoring utility that records or displays
specific operating system data for one or more sets of subsystems.
Any of the subsystems (such as CPU, Disks, Memory or Sockets) can be
included or excluded from data collection.
Data can either be displayed immediately to a terminal, or stored in files
for retrospective analysis.
.PP
.B pcp-collectl
is a
.BR python (1)
script providing much of the functionality available from the
.BR collectl (1)
Linux utility (which happens to be written in
.BR perl (1)).
.PP
It makes use of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) toolkit to
simplify its implementation, as well as provide more of the
.B collectl
functionality on platforms other than Linux.
.PP
.B pcp-collectl
has two primary modes of operation:
.IP 1. 0.3i
Record Mode (\f3\-f\f1 or \f3\-\-filename\f1 option) which reads data
from a live system and writes output to a file or displays it on a terminal.
.IP 2. 0.3i
Playback Mode (\f3\-p\f1 or \f3\-a\f1 option) which reads data
from one or more PCP archive files and displays output on a terminal.
Note that these files are
.I not
raw
.B collectl
format data, rather they are archives created by the
.BR pmlogger (1)
utility (possibly indirectly, through use of the \f3\-f\f1 option to
.BR pcp-collectl ).
.PP
.SH "RECORD MODE OPTIONS"
In this mode data is taken from a 
.BR live
system and either displayed on the terminal or written to a PCP archive.
.PP
.B "\-h host"
.RS
Display metrics from
.I host
instead of displaying metrics from the local host.
.RE
.PP
.\" .B "--align"
.\" .RS
.\" .BR pcp-collectl
.\" sample monitoring will be aligned such that a sample will always be taken at the 
.\" top of a minute (this does NOT mean the first sample will occur then) so that all
.\" instances of
.\" .BR
.\" pmcollect
.\" running on any systems which have their clocks synchronized 
.\" will all take samples at the same time.
.\" .RE
.\" 
.\" .B "--all"
.\" .RS
.\" Collect summary data for ALL subsystems except slabs, since slab monitoring requires
.\" a different monitoring interval.
.\" You can use this switch anywhere \f3\-s\f1 can be used but not both together.
.\" .RE
.\" 
.B "\-c, --count samples"
.RS
The number of samples to record.
.RE
.PP
.\" 
.\" .B "\-D, --daemon"
.\" .RS
.\" Run
.\" .BR pcp-collectl
.\" as a daemon, primarily used when starting as a service.
.\" This option sets the sampling interval to once every 10 seconds by default.
.\" .RE
.\" 
.B "\-f, --filename filename"
.RS
This is the name of a PCP archive to write the output to.
.RE
.PP
.\" 
.\" .B "\-F, --flush seconds"
.\" .RS
.\" Flush output buffers after this number of seconds.  This is equivalent to 
.\" issuing 
.\" .B kill \-s USR1
.\" to
.\" .B pmlogger
.\" at the same frequency (but a lot easier!).  If 0, a flush will occur every
.\" data collection interval.
.\" .RE
.\" 
.\" .B --home
.\" .RS
.\" Always start the display for the current interval at the top of the screen
.\" also known as the home position (non-plot format only).  This generates a
.\" real-time, continuously refreshing display when the data fits on a single screen.
.\" .RE
.\" 
.B "\-i, --interval interval"
.RS
This is the sampling interval in seconds.  The default is 1 second.
.\" The default is 10 seconds when run as a daemon and 1 second otherwise.
.RE
.\" 
.\" .B --nohup
.\" .RS
.\" Whenever collectl finishes a data collection interval, it checks to see if the starting parent
.\" has exited.  This is to prevent the case in which someone might start a copy of collectl
.\" and then the process dies and collectl keeps running.  If that is the behavior someone
.\" actually intends, they should start collectl with --nohup.
.\" 
.\" NOTE - when running as a daemon, --nohup is implied.
.\" .RE
.\" 
.B "\-R, --runtime duration"
.RS
Specify the duration of data collection where the duration is a number followed
by one of 
.BR wdhms,
indicating how many weeks, days, hours, minutes or seconds
the collection is to be taken for.
.RE
.\" 
.PP
.SH "PLAYBACK MODE OPTIONS"
In this mode, data is read from one or more PCP data files that were
generated with the recording option, or indirectly via the
.B pmlogger
utility.
.PP
.B "\-f, --filename filename"
.RS
If specified, this is the name of a PCP archive to write the output to (rather
than the terminal).
.RE
.PP
.\" .B "--from timerange"
.\" .RS
.\" Play back data starting with this time, which may optionally include the ending
.\" time as well, which is of the format of [date:]time[-[date:]time].
.\" The leading 0 of the hour is optional and if the seconds field is not specified
.\" is assumed to be 0.  If no dates specified the time(s) apply to each file specified
.\" by \-P.  Otherwise the time(s) only apply to the first/last dates and any files
.\" between those dates will have all their data reported. 
.\" .RE

.B "\-p, --playback filename"
.RS
Read data from the specified PCP archive folio files(s) \- refer to
.BR pmafm (1)
for archive folio details.

.B "\-a, --archive filename"
.RS
Read data from the specified PCP raw archive files(s).

.\" .B "--thru time"
.\" .RS

.SH "COMMON OPTIONS"
The following options are supported in both record and playback modes.
.PP
.B \--help

Display standard help message.

.PP
.\" 
.\" .B --hr, --headerrepeat num
.\" .RS
.\" Sets the number of intervals to display data for before repeating the header.
.\" A value \-1 will prevent any headers from being displayed and a value of 0
.\" will cause only a single header to be displayed and never repeated.
.\" .RE
.\" 
.\" .B \-N, --nice
.\" .RS
.\" Set priority to a 
.\" .BR nicer
.\" one of 10.
.RE
.B "\-s, --subsys subsystem"
.RS
This field controls which subsystem data is to be collected or played back
for. The rules for displaying results vary depending on the type of data to be
displayed.  If you write data for CPUs and DISKs to a raw file and play it back
with \-sc, you will only see CPU data.  If you play it back with \f3\-scm\f1 you
will still only see CPU data since memory data was not collected.  
.\" However, when  used with \f3\-P\f1,
.\" .B pcp-collectl
.\" will always honor the subsystems specified with 
.\" this switch so in the previous example you will see CPU
.\" data plus memory data of all 0s.  
To see the current set of default subsystems,
which are a subset of this full list,
use \f3\-h\f1.
.PP
.\" You can also use + or \- to add or subtract subsystems to/from the default values. 
.\" For example, "\-s\-cdn+N"< will remove cpu, disk and network monitoring from the
.\" defaults while adding network detail.
.PP
The default is "cdn", which stands for CPU, Disk and Network summary data.

.PD
.B --verbose
.RS
Display output in verbose mode.  This often displays more data than in the default mode.  When 
displaying detail data, verbose mode is forced.  Furthermore, if summary data for a single 
subsystem is to be displayed in verbose mode, the headers are only repeated occasionally whereas
if multiple subsystems are involved each needs their own header.
