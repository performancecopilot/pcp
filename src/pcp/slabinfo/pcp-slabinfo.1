.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pcp\f1
[\f2pcp\ options\f1]
\f3slabinfo\f1

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pcp-slabinfo
command is used for viewing different stats related to slab.
It helps users analyze useful information related to the slab allocator.
The information includes the total number of objects that are currently
active, allocated objects, pages per slab, etc.
By default,
.B pcp-slabinfo
reports live data for the local host.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables. The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
