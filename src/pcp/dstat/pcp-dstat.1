.TH PCP-DSTAT 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pcp-dstat\f1 \- versatile tool for generating system resource statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pcp\f1 [\f2pcp\ options\f1] \f3dstat\f1 [\f2dstat\ options\f1] [\f2delay\f1 [\f2count\f1]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-dstat
is a general performance analysis tool allowing you to view multiple
system resources instantly, for example you can compare disk usage in
combination with interrupts from a disk controller, or compare the
network bandwidth numbers directly with the disk throughput (in the
same interval).
.PP
It also cleverly gives you the most detailed information in columns
and clearly indicates in what magnitude and unit the output is being
displayed.
Less confusion, fewer mistakes, more efficient.
.PP
The
.I delay
is the delay in seconds between each update, and the
.I count
is the number of updates to display before exiting.
The default
.I delay
is 1 second and
.I count
is unspecified (run until interrupted or end of archive is reached).
.PP
This latest generation of Dstat,
.BR pcp-dstat ,
allows for analysis of historical performance data (in the PCP archive
format created by
.BR pmlogger (1)),
as well as distributed systems analysis of live performance data from
remote hosts running the
.BR pmcd (1)
process.
.PP
Additionally, this version introduces configuration files similar to
.BR pmrep.conf (5)
from the
.BR pmrep (1)
utility.
The original Dstat notion of ``plugins'' is replaced by use of named
metrics in a Performance Metric Name Space (\c
.BR PMNS (5)) supplied by Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs).
Metrics and other formatting information is now specified as plugin
configuration files.
This new style of plugin is either built-in (time-related reporting
only), or sourced from the system-wide location (\c
.IR $PCP_ETC_DIR/dstat )
and/or sourced from an individual users set of personal plugins (\c
.IR $HOME/pcp/dstat ).
.PP
The list of all available plugins can be seen using the \fB\-\-list\fR
dstat command line option.
.SH OPTIONS

.BR pcp (1)
command, the
.BR \-h /\c

command.
.PP
The following do not yet have metrics backing them, but have
been included from the original Dstat utility.
Please contact
.I <pcp@groups.io>
if you need or implement any of these, and we'll work with
you to get them included.

.SH INTERMEDIATE UPDATES
When invoking
.B pcp-dstat
with a \fIdelay\fR greater than 1 second and without the \fB\-\-noupdate\fR
option, it will show intermediate updates, ie\&. the first time a 1 second
average, the second update a 2 second average, etc\&. until the \fIdelay\fB
has been reached.
.PP
So in case you specified a delay of 10, \fBthe 9 intermediate updates are NOT snapshots\fR, they are averages over the time that passed since the last final update\&. The end result is that you get a 10 second average on a new line, just like with vmstat\&.
.SH EXAMPLES
Using
.B pcp-dstat
to relate disk\-throughput with network\-usage (eth0), total CPU\-usage and system counters:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pcp-dstat \-dnyc \-N eth0 \-C total \-f 5
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Using the time plugin together with cpu, net, disk, system, load, proc and top_cpu plugins:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pcp-dstat \-tcndylp \-\-top\-cpu
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
this is identical to
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
pcp-dstat \-\-time \-\-cpu \-\-net \-\-disk \-\-sys \-\-load \-\-proc \-\-top\-cpu
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Using pcp-dstat to relate advanced cpu stats with interrupts per device:
.sp
.if n \{\
