.SH NAME
\f3pcp-verify\f1 \- verify aspects of a PCP installation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pcp\ verify\f1
[\fB\-a\fP \fIarchive\fP]
[\f3\-D\f1 \f2debug\f1]
[\fB\-h\fP \fIhost\fP]
[\f3\-csvV?\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-verify
inspects various aspects of a PCP collector installation and reports on
whether it is configured correctly for certain modes of operation.
.PP
By default,
.B pcp-verify
checks that PMCD is running and no agents are in a failed state.
These checks can be extended and refined using the command line options.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-a\fR \fIarchive\fR, \fB\-\-archive\fR=\fIarchive\fR
Use the \fIarchive\fR for verification.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-containers\fR
Verify the collector installation for monitoring containers.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fIhost\fR, \fB\-\-host\fR=\fIhost\fR
Connect to the PMCD on \fIhost\fR for verification.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-secure\fR
Verify that the required components for encrypted communication
are in place.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase the verbosity, and report on each check as it is made.
In the absence of any issues found,
.B pcp-verify
operates silently.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pcp-verify
will exit with a non-zero status if it finds anything worth reporting,
otherwise it is silent and returns zero.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS
The
.B \-D
or
.B \-\-debug
option enables the output of additional diagnostics on
.I stderr
to help triage problems, although the information is sometimes cryptic and
primarily intended to provide guidance for developers rather end-users.
.I debug
is a comma separated list of debugging options; use
.BR pmdbg (1)
with the
.B \-l
option to obtain
a list of the available debugging options and their meaning.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR PCPIntro (1)
and
.BR pcp (1).
