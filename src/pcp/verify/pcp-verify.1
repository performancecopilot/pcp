.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-verify
inspects various aspects of a PCP collector installation and reports on
whether it is configured correctly for certain modes of operation.
.PP
By default,
.B pcp-verify
checks that PMCD is running and no agents are in a failed state.
These checks can be extended and refined using the command line options.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-a\fR \fIarchive\fR, \fB\-\-archive\fR=\fIarchive\fR
Use the \fIarchive\fR for verification.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-containers\fR
Verify the collector installation for monitoring containers.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fIhost\fR, \fB\-\-host\fR=\fIhost\fR
Connect to the PMCD on \fIhost\fR for verification.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-secure\fR
Verify that the required components for encrypted communication
are in place.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase the verbosity, and report on each check as it is made.
In the absence of any issues found,
.B pcp-verify
operates silently.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B pcp-verify
will exit with a non-zero status if it finds anything worth reporting,
otherwise it is silent and returns zero.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
