.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pcp-ps
command is used for monitoring individual process running on the system.
Using various options it helps a user to see useful information related to
the processes.
This information includes CPU percentage, memory and stack usage,
scheduling and priority.
By default
.B pcp-ps
reports live data for the local host.
.SH OPTIONS
When invoked via the
.BR pcp (1)
command, the
.BR \-h /\c
.BR \-\-host ,
.BR \-O /\c
.BR \-\-origin ,
.BR \-t /\c
.BR \-\-interval ,
.BR \-Z /\c
.BR \-\-timezone
and several other
.I pcp options
become indirectly available; refer to
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for a complete description of these options.
.PP
The additional command line options available for
.B pcp-ps
are:
.TP 5
.BR \-e \fR

.br
.TS
l l.
PID	Process identifier.
TTY	The terminal associated with the process.
TIME	T{
.ad l
.hy 0

T}
CMD	The task name along with its complete arguments.	
.TE
.TP
.B \-c [\fIcommand name\fR]
Display the real Command name of the tasks being monitored instead of the UID.

command are displayed.
.TP
.BR \-U \ [\fIusername\fR] ", " \fB\-\-user\-name\fR[=\fIusername\fR]
Display the real user name of the tasks being monitored instead of the UID.
If \fIusername\fR is specified, then only tasks belonging to the specified
user are displayed.
.TP
.BR \-V \fR ", " \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version number then exit.
.TP
.BR \-p \ \fIpid1,pid2..\fR ", " \fB\-\-pid-list\fR=\fIpid1,pid2..\fR
Display only processes with the listed PIDs.
.TP
.BR \-P \ \fIppid1,ppid2..\fR ", " \fB\-\-ppid-list\fR=\fIppid1,ppid2..\fR
Display only processes with the listed PPIDs.
.TP
.B \-o
User-defined format.

It is a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a way to specify individual output columns.

The argument to -o are following:

.SH "STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS"
Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output
format (e.g. with option
.BR \-o )
or to sort the selected processes

For example:
.B pcp-ps \-o pid,\:user,\:args

.TS

lfB  l    lx.
CODE	HEADER	DESCRIPTION
_	_	_
pid	PID	a number representing the process ID
%cpu	%CPU	T{
.ad l
.hy 0
%cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.
.br
Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the
process has been running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage.
T}
%mem	%MEM	T{
.ad l
.hy 0
%ratio of the process's resident set size  to the physical memory on the
machine, expressed as a percentage.
T}
args	COMMAND	T{
.ad l
.hy 0
Command with all its arguments as a string. Modifications to the arguments
may be shown.  The output in this column may contain spaces.  A process
marked <defunct> is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.
Sometimes the process args will be unavailable; when this happens,will instead print the executable name in brackets.
T}
class	CLS	T{
.ad l
.hy 0
scheduling class of the process.
.br
Field's possible values are:
\-      not reported

Device mappings are currently excluded; this is subject to change.
T}

.TE
.TP
.BR \-Z \ \fItimezone\fR ", "\fB\-\-timezone=\fItimezone\fR
By default,
.B pcp-ps
reports the time of day according to the local timezone on the system where
.B pcp-ps
is run.
The
.B \-Z
option changes the timezone to
.I timezone
in the format of the environment variable
.B TZ
as described in
.BR environ (7).
.TP
.BR \-z " , " \fB\-\-hostzone\fR
Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the host that is
the source of the performance metrics.
When replaying a PCP archive that was captured in a foreign timezone, the
.B \-z
option would almost always be used (the default reporting timezone is the
local timezone, which may not be the same as the timezone of the PCP archive).
.TP
.BR \-? " , " \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH NOTES
.B pcp-ps
is inspired by the
.BR ps (1)
command and aims to be command line and output compatible with it.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3).
