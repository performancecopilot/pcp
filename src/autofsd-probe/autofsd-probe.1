.SH DESCRIPTION
.B autofsd-probe
will check the status of the
.BR autofsd (1)
daemon on the specified
.IR host .

file system is built on the Remote Procedure Call (\c
.BR RPC (3))
library routines.  The
.B \-t
option allows the total timeout and retry timeout intervals to be set for all
remote procedure call operations used with
.BR autofsd-probe .
This option accepts an interval argument in the form described in the
.BR PCPIntro (1)
manual page.

.B autofsd-probe
is typically used in an automated fashion from within
.BR pmdashping (1)
and in conjunction with
.BR pmie (1),
for monitoring response time and service failure.
.PP
By default
.B autofsd-probe
will not produce any output, unless there is an error in which case
a diagnostic message will be displayed and the exit status will indicate
the reason for failure.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If
.B autofsd-probe
succeeds, then 0 will be returned.
If the attempt to establish a connection with
.B autofsd
fails, then 2 is returned.
If the subsequent attempt to invoke an
.B autofsd
response fails, then 1 will be returned.
.PP
In the case of a syntactical command line error, 4 is returned and the
usage message is displayed.
.SH "PCP ENVIRONMENT"
Environment variables with the prefix
.B PCP_
are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP.
On each installation, the file
.I /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables.
The
.B $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file,
as described in
.BR pcp.conf (5).
