# Environment variables for the pmcd daemon.  Refer also to the
# pmcd.options and pmcd.conf files for additional configuration.

# Behaviour regarding listening on external-facing interfaces;
# unset PMCD_LOCAL to allow connections from remote hosts.
# A value of 0 permits remote connections, 1 permits local only.
# PMCD_LOCAL=1

# Max length to which the queue of pending connections may grow
# A value of 5 is the default.
# PMCD_MAXPENDING=5

# Default behaviour regarding pmcd's approach to starting PMDAs;
# In cases where pmdaroot is available, setting this variable to
# 1, offloads starting and stopping of agents to pmdaroot.  This
# allows pmcd to not require a restart when starting a new PMDA.
PMCD_ROOT_AGENT=1

# Default behaviour regarding pmcd's approach to re-starting any
# unresponsive PMDAs; this should only be used with pmdaroot and
# PMCD_ROOT_AGENT=1 as it allows pmcd to attempt to automatically
# restart any exited PMDA that it detects (which usually requires
# privileges not available to pmcd itself).
PMCD_RESTART_AGENTS=1

# Default timeout for waiting on pmcd to accept connections; any
# longer than this value and the rc scripts report it as failed.
# The value is a PCPIntro(1) interval in units of seconds and it
# will be passed directly to the pmcd_wait(1) utility.
# PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT=60
