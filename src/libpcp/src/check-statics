# Lines containing one word are assumed to be the name of an
# object file ... if any object file is found in the current
# directory that is not named in the control file, this is an
# error.  Object file names beginning with '?' are optional,
# otherwise the object file is expected to exist.
#
# Following the name of an object file follows zero or more
# lines defining static data symbols from that object file that is
# known to be thread-safe ... these lines contain the symbol's type
# as reported by nm(1) (this may be a regular expression for a set of
# types as in [...] for cases where different compilers map the symbol
# to different types), the symbol and by convention an comment
# explaining why the symbol is thread-safe.  The symbol may be
# preceded by a '?' character to indicate the symbol may or may not
# be in the object file, otherwise a symbol named here that is not
# in the object file produces a warning.
