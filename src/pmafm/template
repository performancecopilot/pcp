PCPFolio
Version: 1

Created: on hostname at ctime	#abitrary string
Creator: pmchart [config]

# use pmfolio(1) to process this PCP Archive Folio
#

# Notes
#
# 0. first two lines are "magic", and know to various scripts and
#    tools
#
# 1. blank lines are skipped, # introduces a comment line ... more
#    strictly, after the first two lines, only lines containing one
#    of the magic keyword strings ("Created: ", "Creator: " and
#    "Archive: " are ever looked at
#
# 2. in the Created: line, hostname should be the hostname where the
#    creator pmlogger instances were running, and ctime should be
#    the creator's local time in ctime(3) format ... both are for
#    annotation, so do not worry too much about them ... pmfolio's
#    "list" command echoes this line verbatim
#
# 3. [config] is optional, and if present is used to replay with the
#    Creator using all of the archives in the folio ... e.g. pmchart's
#    config file for all of the charts that were visible when "record"
#    mode started.  Creator: is expected to be one of "pmchart",
#    "pmview", or "cron.pmdaily" ... yes, this will happen!
#
# 4. for a Basename of eek, expect to find
#	eek.meta
#	eek.index
#	eek.0
#	eek.1, ...	[ maybe ]
#	eek.pmlogger	[ maybe, pmlogger config used to create _this_ archive ]
