.TH PCP-XSOS 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pcp-xsos\f1 \- high-level summary reports for a system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pcp\f1
[\f2pcp\ options\f1]
\f3xsos\f1
[\f3\-\-all\f1]
[\f3\-dmnNopx\f1]
[\f3\-u\f1 \f2units\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-xsos
gives a summary report of a system using either a PCP archive
or live metric values from that system.
.PP
It is designed to be fast and performs a single-sample only,
similar to tools like
.BR ps (1).
Thus, level of detail in reporting is traded off in favour of
execution speed.
.B pcp-xsos
is designed as an initial performance triage tool that
quickly informs an operator as to avenues of investigation
that may prove more fruitful.
At this time the focus is entirely on operating system metrics,
however this is not a requirement and in time it may be extended
to report on any performance domain with associated PCP metrics.
.PP
When invoked via the
.BR pcp (1)
command, the
.BR \-h /\c
.BR \-\-host ,
.BR \-a /\c
.BR \-\-archive ,
.BR \-O /\c
.BR \-\-origin
.B pcp
.I options
become indirectly available, see
.BR PCPIntro (1)
for their descriptions.
.PP
The default report with no command line options presented is
the operating system overview.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-\-all\fP
iteratively report each subsection, one after the other.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-os\fP
display the default report with high level kernel information,
including version, uptime, number of users, process states and
aggregated processor utilisation.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-disks\fP
Report storage information from the archive or live host,
including the total capacity for each block device as well
as available filesystem space for each mounted filesystem.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-memory\fP
Detailed memory report, including percentage of total memory
used for various operating system functions, swap use, and
optionally hugepages and virtual machine balloon information.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-netdev\fP
Statistics for each configured network interface, including
packet and byte transfer rates (since boot), errors, drops,
and so on.
Additionally, socket statistics are also reported with this
command line option, for raw, UDP and TCP (IPv4 and IPv6).
.TP
\fB\-N\fP, \fB\-\-netstats\fP
Report aggregate network statistics such as various ICMP and
TCP error and timeout counters.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-ps\fP
Inspect running processes in a style similar to
.BR ps .
These are grouped and filtered to show the most important
processes in terms of resource use (CPU, memory) as well as
processes in zombie or blocked states.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR \fIunit\fP, \fB\-\-units\fR=\fIunit\fR
Change the byte display for various reports.
Valid values for
.I unit
are "b" (bytes), "k" (kibibytes), "m" (mibibytes), "g"
(gibibytes) or "t" (tebibytes).
.TP
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-nocolor\fP
Display reports without using colors to highlight various
aspects of each subsystem.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.SH NOTES
.B pcp-xsos
is inspired by the
.BR xsos
utility, aims to be command line compatible with it where possible
and also provide a consistent output style.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.PP
For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see \fBpmGetOptions\fP(3)
which provides \fBpmgetopt\fP(1) functionality used by \fBpcp-xsos\fP.
